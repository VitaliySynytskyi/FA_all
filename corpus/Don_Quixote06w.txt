and advice of the curate covered their faces and disguised themselves some in one way some in another so as to appear to 
don quixote quite different from the persons he had seen in the castle this done in profound 
silence they entered the room where he was asleep taking his his rest after the past frays 
and advancing to where he was sleeping tranquilly not dreaming of anything of the kind 
happening they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot so that when he awoke 
startled he was unable to move and could only marvel and wonder at the strange figures 
he saw before him upon which he at once gave way to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably 
conjured up before him and took it into his head that this was a case of adventure and that 
it fell to him alone as a knighterrant to engage in it and he was all the more confirmed in 
this notion by the idea that an image draped in black they had with them was some illustrious 
lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were carrying off by force as soon 
as this occurred to him he ran with all speed to rocinante who was grazing at large and taking 
the bridle and the buckler from the saddlebow he had him bridled in an instant and calling 
to sancho for his sword he mounted rocinante braced his buckler on his arm put his lance 
in rest and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a halfgallop exclaiming 
whoever shall say that i have been enchanted with just cause provided my lady the princess 
micomicona grants me permission to do so i give him the lie challenge him and defy him to 
single combat the newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of don quixote but 
the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was and not to mind him as he 
was out of his senses they then asked the landlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen 
years of age from whom the cries came nor were they without cause for a lusty farmer was 
flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands repeating 
your mouth shut and your eyes open while the youth made answer i wont do it again master 
mine by gods passion i wont do it again and ill take more care of the flock another time seeing 
what was going on don quixote said in an angry voice discourteous knight it ill becomes 
you to assail one who cannot defend himself mount your steed and take your lance for there 
was a lance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied and i will make you know that 
you are behaving as a coward the farmer seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing 
a lance over his head gave himself up for dead and made answer meekly sir knight this youth 
that i am chastising is my servant employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that i have hard 
by and he is so careless that i lose one every day and when i punish him for his carelessness 
and knavery he says i do it out of niggardliness to escape paying him the wages i owe him 
and before god and on my soul he lies lies before me base clown said don quixote by the sun 
that shines on us i have a mind to run you through with this lance pay him at once without 
another word if not by the god that rules us i will make an end of you and annihilate you on 
the spot release him instantly the farmer hung his head and without a word untied his servant 
of whom don quixote asked how much his master owed him he replied nine months at seven reals 
a month don quixote added it up found that it came to sixtythree reals and told the farmer 
to pay it down immediately if he did not want to die for it the trembling clown replied that 
as he lived and by the oath he had sworn though he had not sworn any it was not so much for there 
were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him and a real 
for two bloodlettings when he was sick all that is very well said don quixote but let the 
shoes and the bloodlettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him without 
any cause for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for you have damaged that of 
his body and if the barber took blood from him when he was sick you have drawn it when he was 
sound so on that score he owes you nothing the difficulty is sir knight that i have no money 
here let andres come home with me and i will pay him all real by real i go with him said the 
youth nay god forbid no senor not for the world for once alone with me he would ray me like 
a saint bartholomew he will do nothing of the kind said don quixote i have only to command 
and he will obey me and as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he has received 
i leave him free and i guarantee the payment consider what you are saying senor said the 
youth this master of mine is not a knight nor has he received any order of knighthood for 
he is juan haldudo the rich of quintanar that matters little replied don quixote there 
may be haldudos knights moreover everyone is the son of his works that is true said andres 
but this master of mineof what works is he the son when he refuses me the wages of my sweat 
and labour i do not refuse brother andres said the farmer be good enough to come along with 
me and i swear by all the orders of knighthood there are in the world to pay you as i have agreed 
real by real and perfumed for the perfumery i excuse you said don quixote give it to him 
in reals and i shall be satisfied and see that you do as you have sworn if not by the same oath 
i swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you and i shall find you though you should 
lie closer than a lizard and if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you that 
you be more firmly bound to obey it know that i am the valorous don quixote of la mancha the 
instant don quixote heard his own name be started to his feet and listened with open ears 
to catch what they said about him and heard the don jeronimo who had been addressed say 
in reply why would you have us read that absurd stuff don juan when it is impossible for 
anyone who has read the first part of this history will remember well enough the gines 
de pasamonte whom with other galley slaves don quixote set free in the sierra morena a 
kindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evilminded 
illconditioned set this gines de pasamontedon ginesillo de parapilla don quixote called 
himit was that stole dapple from sancho panza which because by the fault of the printers 
neither the how nor the when was stated in the first part has been a puzzle to a good many 
people who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the press in fact 
however gines stole him while sancho panza was asleep on his back adopting the plan and 
device that brunello had recourse to when he stole sacripantes horse from between his 
legs at the siege of albracca and as has been told sancho afterwards recovered him this 
gines then afraid of being caught by the officers of justice who were looking for him to 
punish him for his numberless rascalities and offences which were so many and so great 
that he himself wrote a big book giving an account of them resolved to shift his quarters 
into the kingdom of aragon and cover up his left eye and take up the trade of a puppetshowman 
for this as well as juggling he knew how to practise to perfection from some released christians 
returning from barbary it so happened he bought the ape which he taught to mount upon his 
shoulder on his making a certain sign and to whisper or seem to do so in his ear thus prepared 
before entering any village whither he was bound with his show and his ape he used to inform 
himself at the nearest village or from the most likely person he could find as to what particular 
things had happened there and to whom and bearing them well in mind the first thing he did 
was to stretch himself all over and then he went to where rocinante was standing and giving 
him a couple of slaps on the back saying lie down here beside me spotty for we have time enough 
to return to our fold the goat seemed to understand him for as her master seated himself 
she stretched herself quietly beside him and looked up in his face to show him she was all 
attention to what he was going to say and then in these words he began his story chapter 
li which deals with what the goatherd told those who were carrying off don quixote three 
leagues from this valley there is a village which though small is one of the richest in 
all this neighbourhood and in it there lived a farmer a very worthy man and so much respected 
that although to be so is the natural consequence of being rich he was even more respected 
for his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired but what made him still more fortunate 
as he said himself was having a daughter of such exceeding beauty rare intelligence gracefulness 
and virtue that everyone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary gifts 
with which heaven and nature had endowed her as a child she was beautiful she continued 
to grow in beauty and at the age of sixteen she was most lovely the fame of her beauty began 
to spread abroad through all the villages aroundbut why do i say the villages around merely 
when it spread to distant cities and even made its way into the halls of royalty and reached 
the ears of people of every class who came from all sides to see her as if to see something 
rare and curious or some wonderworking image her father watched over her and she watched 
over herself for there are no locks or guards or bolts that can protect a young girl better 
than her own modesty the wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter led many neighbours 
as well as strangers to seek her for a wife but he as one might well be who had the disposal 
of so rich a jewel was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her countless 
suitors he should entrust her i was one among the many who felt a desire so natural and as 
her father knew who i was and i was of the same town of pure blood in the bloom of life and very 
rich in possessions i had great hopes of success there was another of the same place and 
qualifications who also sought her and this made her fathers choice hang in the balance 
for he felt that on either of us his daughter would be well bestowed so to escape from this 
state of perplexity he resolved to refer the matter to leandra for that is the name of this 
unhappy being see here i give you my hand to be yours and let heaven from which nothing is 
hid and this image of our lady you have here be witnesses of this pledge when cardenio heard 
her say she was called dorothea he showed fresh agitation and felt convinced of the truth 
of his former suspicion but he was unwilling to interrupt the story and wished to hear 
the end of what he already all but knew so he merely said what is dorothea your name senora 
i have heard of another of the same name who can perhaps match your misfortunes but proceed 
byandby i may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your compassion 
dorothea was struck by cardenios words as well as by his strange and miserable attire 
and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to tell it to her at once for if fortune 
had left her any blessing it was courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her 
as she felt sure that none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she 
endured already i would not let the occasion pass senora replied cardenio of telling 
you what i think if what i suspect were the truth but so far there has been no opportunity 
nor is it of any importance to you to know it be it as it may replied dorothea what happened 
in my story was that don fernando taking an image that stood in the chamber placed it as 
a witness of our betrothal and with the most binding words and extravagant oaths gave 
me his promise to become my husband though before he had made an end of the one to which he 
was pledged he would have attacked the whole of them and would have made them return an 
answer in spite of themselves but considering that it would not become him nor be right 
to begin any new emprise until he had established micomicona in her kingdom he was constrained 
to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of 
those same travellers one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by the 
side of a muleteer without a thought of anyone coming in search of him much less finding 
him the man laid hold of him by the arm saying it becomes you well indeed senor don luis to 
be in the dress you wear and well the bed in which i find you agrees with the luxury in which 
your mother reared you the youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who 
held him but presently recognised him as one of his fathers servants at which he was so 
taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter a word while the servant went on 
to say there is nothing for it now senor don luis but to submit quietly and return home unless 
it is your wish that my lord your father should take his departure for the other world for 
nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at your absence but how did my father 
know that i had gone this road and in this dress said don luis it was a student to whom you 
confided your intentions answered the servant that disclosed them touched with pity 
at the distress he saw your father suffer on missing you he therefore despatched four 
of his servants in quest of you and here we all are at your service better pleased than you 
can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to restore you to those eyes that so 
yearn for you that shall be as i please or as heaven orders returned don luis what can you 
please or heaven order said the other except to agree to go back anything else is impossible 
all this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at whose side don 
luis lay and rising he went to report what had taken place to don fernando cardenio and 
the others who had by this time dressed themselves and told them how the man had addressed 
the youth as don and what words had passed and how he wanted him to return to his father which 
the youth was unwilling to do with this and what they already knew of the rare voice that 
heaven had bestowed upon him they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who 
he was and even to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him so they hastened 
to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant dorothea at this instant came 
out of her room followed by dona clara all in a tremor and calling cardenio aside she told 
him in a few words the story of the musician and dona clara and he at the same time told her 
what had happened how his fathers servants had come in search of him but in telling her 
so he did not speak low enough but that dona clara heard what he said at which she was so much 
agitated that had not dorothea hastened to support her she would have fallen to the ground 
cardenio then bade dorothea return to her room as he would endeavour to make the whole 
matter right and they did as he desired all the four who had come in quest of don luis had 
now come into the inn and surrounded him urging him to return and console his father at 
once and without a moments delay he replied that he could not do so on any account until 
he had concluded some business in which his life honour and heart were at stake the servants 
pressed him saying that most certainly they would not return without him and that they 
would take him away whether he liked it or not you shall not do that replied don luis unless 
you take me dead though however you take me it will be without life by this time most of those 
in the inn had been attracted by the dispute but particularly cardenio don fernando his 
companions the judge the curate the barber and don quixote for he now considered there 
was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer cardenio being already 
acquainted with the young mans story asked the men who wanted to take him away what object 
they had in seeking to carry off this youth against his will our object said one of the four 
is to save the life of his father who is in danger of losing it through this gentlemans disappearance 
upon this don luis exclaimed there is no need to make my affairs public here i am free and 
i will return if i please and if not none of you shall compel me reason will compel your worship 
said the man and if it has no power over you it has power over us to make us do what we came for 
and what it is our duty to do let us hear what the whole affair is about said the judge at this 
but the man who knew him as a neighbour of theirs replied do you not know this gentleman 
senor judge he is the son of your neighbour who has run away from his fathers house in a dress 
so unbecoming his rank as your worship may perceive the judge on this looked at him more 
carefully and recognised him and embracing him said what folly is this senor don luis 
or what can have been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way and in 
this dress which so ill becomes your condition tears came into the eyes of the young man 
and he was unable to utter a word in reply to the judge who told the four servants not to be 
uneasy for all would be satisfactorily settled and then taking don luis by the hand he 
drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there but while he was questioning 
him they heard a loud outcry at the gate of the inn which was still shut on seeing which don 
quixote even there where he was did not forget to act as sentinel and said in a loud and imperious 
tone knights or squires or whatever ye be ye have no right to knock at the gates of this castle 
for it is plain enough that they who are within are either asleep or else are not in the habit 
of throwing open the fortress until the suns rays are spread over the whole surface of 
the earth withdraw to a distance and wait till it is broad daylight and then we shall see 
whether it will be proper or not to open to you what the devil fortress or castle is this 
said one to make us stand on such ceremony if you are the innkeeper bid them open to us we 
are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on for we are in haste do you think 
gentlemen that i look like an innkeeper said don quixote i dont know whether he called 
himself friston or friton said the housekeeper i only know that his name ended with ton 
so it does said don quixote and he is a sage magician a great enemy of mine who has a spite 
against me because he knows by his arts and lore that in process of time i am to engage in 
single combat with a knight whom he befriends and that i am to conquer and he will be unable 
to prevent it and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he can but 
i promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is decreed by heaven who doubts 
that said the niece but uncle who mixes you up in these quarrels would it not be better to 
remain at peace in your own house instead of roaming the world looking for better bread 
than ever came from wheat in other mens houses it wont do for the curate to have a shepherdess 
for the sake of good example and if the bachelor chooses to have one that is his lookout 
god bless me sancho my friend said don quixote but to enable thee to recover strength we 
must keep it for our own village for at the latest we shall get there the day after tomorrow 
sancho said he might do as he pleased but that for his own part he would like to finish off 
the business quickly before his blood cooled and while he had an appetite because in delay 
there is apt to be danger the distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his 
hands but don quixote who was in all things a polished and courteous knight would by no 
means allow it but made her rise and embraced her with great courtesy and politeness and 
ordered sancho to look to rocinantes girths and to arm him without a moments delay sancho 
took down the armour which was hung up on a tree like a trophy and having seen to the girths 
armed his master in a trice who as soon as he found himself on the ground looked at the rent 
in his huntingcoat and was grieved to the heart for he thought he had got a patrimonial 
estate in that suit meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule and 
having covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle they bore it away as the 
spoils of victory to some large fieldtents which had been pitched in the middle of the 
wood where they found the tables laid and dinner served in such grand and sumptuous style 
that it was easy to see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it sancho as 
he showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess observed if we had been hunting hares 
or after small birds my coat would have been safe from being in the plight its in i dont know 
what pleasure one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with his 
tusk if he gets at you i recollect having heard an old ballad sung that says by bears be thou 
devoured as erst was famous favila that said don quixote was a gothic king who going ahunting 
was devoured by a bear just so said sancho and i would not have kings and princes expose 
themselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which to my mind ought not to be one 
as it consists in killing an animal that has done no harm whatever quite the contrary sancho 
you are wrong there said the duke for hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings 
and princes than for anybody else the chase is the emblem of war it has stratagems wiles 
and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety in it extreme cold and intolerable 
heat have to be borne indolence and sleep are despised the bodily powers are invigorated 
the limbs of him who engages in it are made supple and in a word it is a pursuit which may be 
followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many and the best of it is that 
this king or prince or whatever he is is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful 
as himself and the stranger knight after having been some days at his court requests leave 
from him to go and serve him in the said war the king will grant it very readily and the knight 
will courteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him and that night he will take leave 
of his lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps which looks upon 
a garden and at which he has already many times conversed with her the gobetween and confidante 
in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess he will sigh she will swoon the 
damsel will fetch water much distressed because morning approaches and for the honour 
of her lady he would not that they were discovered at last the princess will come to herself 
and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight who will kiss them a 
thousand and a thousand times bathing them with his tears it will be arranged between 
them how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes and the princess will 
entreat him to make his absence as short as possible which he will promise to do with many 
oaths once more he kisses her hands and takes his leave in such grief that he is wellnigh 
ready to die he betakes him thence to his chamber flings himself on his bed cannot sleep 
for sorrow at parting rises early in the morning goes to take leave of the king queen and 
princess and as he takes his leave of the pair it is told him that the princess is indisposed 
and cannot receive a visit the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure his heart 
is pierced and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain the confidante is present 
observes all goes to tell her mistress who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest 
distresses is not knowing who this knight is and whether he is of kingly lineage or not 
the damsel assures her that so much courtesy gentleness and gallantry of bearing as her 
knight possesses could not exist in any save one who was royal and illustrious her anxiety 
is thus relieved and she strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in 
her parents and at the end of two hours came to himself meanwhile the wind having changed 
we were compelled to head for the land and ply our oars to avoid being driven on shore but 
it was our good fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of a small promontory or cape 
called by the moors that of the cava rumia which in our language means the wicked christian 
woman for it is a tradition among them that la cava through whom spain was lost lies buried 
at that spot cava in their language meaning wicked woman and rumia christian moreover 
they count it unlucky to anchor there when necessity compels them and they never do so 
otherwise for us however it was not the restingplace of the wicked woman but a haven of 
safety for our relief so much had the sea now got up we posted a lookout on shore and never 
let the oars out of our hands and ate of the stores the renegade had laid in imploring god 
and our lady with all our hearts to help and protect us that we might give a happy ending 
to a beginning so prosperous at the entreaty of zoraida orders were given to set on shore 
her father and the other moors who were still bound for she could not endure nor could her 
tender heart bear to see her father in bonds and her fellowcountrymen prisoners before 
her eyes we promised her to do this at the moment of departure for as it was uninhabited 
we ran no risk in releasing them at that place our prayers were not so far in vain as to be 
unheard by heaven for after a while the wind changed in our favour and made the sea calm 
inviting us once more to resume our voyage with a good heart seeing this we unbound the 
moors and one by one put them on shore at which they were filled with amazement but when 
we came to land zoraidas father who had now completely recovered his senses he said why 
is it think ye christians that this wicked woman is rejoiced at your giving me my liberty 
think ye it is because of the affection she bears me nay verily it is only because of the 
hindrance my presence offers to the execution of her base designs and think not that it 
is her belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change her religion it is 
only because she knows that immodesty is more freely practised in your country than in 
ours then turning to zoraida while i and another of the christians held him fast by both 
arms lest he should do some mad act he said to her infamous girl misguided maiden whither 
in thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these dogs our natural enemies 
cursed be the hour when i begot thee cursed the luxury and indulgence in which i reared 
thee but seeing that he was not likely soon to cease i made haste to put him on shore and thence 
he continued his maledictions and lamentations aloud calling on mohammed to pray to 
allah to destroy us to confound us to make an end of us and when in consequence of having 
made sail we could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did how he plucked out 
his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground but once he raised his voice to 
such a pitch that we were able to hear what he said come back dear daughter come back to shore 
i forgive thee all let those men have the money for it is theirs now and come back to comfort 
thy sorrowing father who will yield up his life on this barren strand if thou dost leave 
him all this zoraida heard and heard with sorrow and tears and all she could say in answer 
was allah grant that lela marien who has made me become a christian give thee comfort in 
thy sorrow my father allah knows that i could not do otherwise than i have done and that 
these christians owe nothing to my will for even had i wished not to accompany them but 
remain at home it would have been impossible for him to accomplish it but they write curtly 
don paralipomenon of the three stars accomplished the adventure of the six monsters 
without mentioning such a person as his squire who was there all the time just as if there 
was no such being once more sirs i say my master may go alone and much good may it do him and 
ill stay here in the company of my lady the duchess and maybe when he comes back he will find 
the lady dulcineas affair ever so much advanced for i mean in leisure hours and at idle 
moments to give myself a spell of whipping without so much as a hair to cover me for all that 
you must go if it be necessary my good sancho said the duchess for they are worthy folk who 
ask you and the faces of these ladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of your 
idle fears that would be a hard case indeed in the kings name once more said sancho if this 
charitable work were to be done for the sake of damsels in confinement or charitygirls 
a man might expose himself to some hardships but to bear it for the sake of stripping beards 
off duennas devil take it id sooner see them all bearded from the highest to the lowest 
and from the most prudish to the most affected you are very hard on duennas sancho my friend 
said the duchess you incline very much to the opinion of the toledo apothecary but indeed 
you are wrong there are duennas in my house that may serve as patterns of duennas and here 
is my dona rodriguez who will not allow me to say otherwise your excellence may say it if 
you like said the rodriguez for god knows the truth of everything and whether we duennas 
are good or bad bearded or smooth we are our mothers daughters like other women and as god 
sent us into the world he knows why he did and on his mercy i rely and not on anybodys beard 
well senora rodriguez senora trifaldi and present company said don quixote i trust in 
heaven that it will look with kindly eyes upon your troubles for sancho will do as i bid 
him only let clavileno come and let me find myself face to face with malambruno and i am 
certain no razor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shave malambrunos head 
off his shoulders for god bears with the wicked but not for ever ah exclaimed the distressed 
one at this may all the stars of the celestial regions look down upon your greatness with 
benign eyes valiant knight and shed every prosperity and valour upon your heart that 
it may be the shield and safeguard of the abused and downtrodden race of duennas detested 
by apothecaries sneered at by squires and made game of by pages ill betide the jade that 
in the flower of her youth would not sooner become a nun than a duenna unfortunate beings 
that we are we duennas though we may be descended in the direct male line from hector of 
troy himself our mistresses never fail to address us as you if they think it makes queens 
of them o giant malambruno though thou art an enchanter thou art true to thy promises send 
us now the peerless clavileno that our misfortune may be brought to an end for if the hot 
weather sets in and these beards of ours are still there alas for our lot the trifaldi said 
this in such a pathetic way that she drew tears from the eyes of all and even sanchos filled 
up and he resolved in his heart to commit no treason to his lady dulcinea del toboso even 
though the queen guinevere herself and the dame quintanona should present themselves 
before him while he was taken up with these vagaries then the time and the houran unlucky 
one for himarrived for the asturian to come who in her smock with bare feet and her hair 
gathered into a fustian coif with noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where 
the three were quartered in quest of the carrier but scarcely had she gained the door when 
don quixote perceived her and sitting up in his bed in spite of his plasters and the pain 
of his ribs he stretched out his arms to receive his beauteous damsel the asturian who 
went all doubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for her lover encountered 
the arms of don quixote who grasped her tightly by the wrist and drawing her towards him 
while she dared not utter a word made her sit down on the bed he then felt her smock and although 
it was of sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk on her wrists 
she wore some glass beads but to him they had the sheen of precious orient pearls her hair 
which in some measure resembled a horses mane he rated as threads of the brightest gold 
of araby whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself her breath which no doubt smelt of yesterdays 
stale salad seemed to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth and in short 
he drew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the same style as 
that which he had seen in his books of the other princesses who smitten by love came with 
all the adornments that are here set down to see the sorely wounded knight and so great 
was the poor gentlemans blindness that neither touch nor smell nor anything else about 
the good lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit were enough to undeceive him 
on the contrary he was persuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his arms and holding her 
firmly in his grasp he went on to say in low tender voice would that found myself lovely 
and exalted lady in a position to repay such a favour as that which you by the sight of your 
great beauty have granted me but fortune which is never weary of persecuting the good 
has chosen to place me upon this bed where i lie so bruised and broken that though my inclination 
would gladly comply with yours it is impossible besides to this impossibility another 
yet greater is to be added which is the faith that i have pledged to the peerless dulcinea 
del toboso sole lady of my most secret thoughts and were it not that this stood in the way 
i should not be so insensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great 
goodness has offered me maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held 
so fast by don quixote and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to her she 
strove without speaking to free herself the worthy carrier whose unholy thoughts kept 
him awake was aware of his doxy the moment she entered the door and was listening attentively 
to all don quixote said and jealous that the asturian should have broken her word with 
him for another drew nearer to don quixotes bed and stood still to see what would come of 
this abstraction and with no little pity for from his behaviour now staring at the ground 
with fixed gaze and at length said thou hast behaved lothario as i expected of thy friendship 
i will follow thy advice in everything do as thou wilt and keep this secret as thou seest 
it should be kept in circumstances so unlooked for lothario gave him his word but after 
leaving him he repented altogether of what he had said to him perceiving how foolishly 
he had acted as he might have revenged himself upon camilla in some less cruel and degrading 
way he cursed his want of sense condemned his hasty resolution and knew not what course 
to take to undo the mischief or find some ready escape from it at last he decided upon revealing 
all to camilla and as there was no want of opportunity for doing so he found her alone the 
same day but she as soon as she had the chance of speaking to him said lothario my friend 
i must tell thee i have a sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst 
and it will be a wonder if he succeeds for it will be only hurry hurry with him like the tailor 
on easter eve and works done in a hurry are never finished as perfectly as they ought to 
be let master moor or whatever he is pay attention to what he is doing and i and my master 
will give him as much grouting ready to his hand in the way of adventures and accidents 
of all sorts as would make up not only one second part but a hundred the good man fancies 
no doubt that we are fast asleep in the straw here but let him hold up our feet to be shod and 
he will see which foot it is we go lame on all i say is that if my master would take my advice 
we would be now afield redressing outrages and righting wrongs as is the use and custom 
of good knightserrant sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of rocinante 
fell upon their ears which neighing don quixote accepted as a happy omen and he resolved 
to make another sally in three or four days from that time announcing his intention to 
the bachelor he asked his advice as to the quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition 
and the bachelor replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of aragon and 
the city of saragossa where there were to be certain solemn joustings at the festival 
of st george at which he might win renown above all the knights of aragon which would be 
winning it above all the knights of the world he commended his very praiseworthy and gallant 
resolution but admonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers 
because his life did not belong to him but to all those who had need of him to protect and 
aid them in their misfortunes theres where it is what i abominate senor samson said sancho 
here my master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy would half a dozen melons 
body of the world senor bachelor there is a time to attack and a time to retreat and it is 
not to be always santiago and close spain moreover i have heard it said and i think by my 
master himself if i remember rightly that the mean of valour lies between the extremes 
of cowardice and rashness and if that be so i dont want him to fly without having good reason 
or to attack when the odds make it better not but above all things i warn my master that if 
he is to take me with him it must be on the condition that he is to do all the fighting and that 
i am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge and that if any of the lashes happen to 
be flyflappers they are to count item that in case i should make any mistake in the reckoning 
senor merlin as he knows everything is to keep count and let me know how many are still wanting 
or over the number there will be no need to let you know of any over said merlin because when 
you reach the full number the lady dulcinea will at once and that very instant be disenchanted 
and will come in her gratitude to seek out the worthy sancho and thank him and even reward 
him for the good work so you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes too many or too few heaven 
forbid i should cheat anyone of even a hair of his head well then in gods hands be it said 
sancho in the hard case im in i give in i say i accept the penance on the conditions laid down 
the instant sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarions struck up once more 
and again a host of muskets were discharged and don quixote hung on sanchos neck kissing 
him again and again on the forehead and cheeks the duchess and the duke expressed the greatest 
satisfaction the car began to move on and as it passed the fair dulcinea bowed to the duke 
and duchess and to the kings and looking sideways at don quixote said to him god forgive 
thee insensible knight for through thy cruelty i have been to me it seems more than a thousand 
years in the other world and to thee the most compassionate upon earth i render thanks 
for the life i am now in possession of from this day forth friend sancho count as thine six 
smocks of mine which i bestow upon thee to make as many shirts for thyself and if they are 
not all quite whole at any rate they are all clean sancho kissed her hands in gratitude 
kneeling and with the mitre in his hand the duke bade them take it from him and give him back 
his cap and doublet and remove the flaming robe sancho begged the duke to let them leave 
him the robe and mitre as he wanted to take them home for a token and memento of that unexampled 
adventure the duchess said they must leave them with him for he knew already what a great 
friend of his she was the duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared and that 
all should retire to their chambers and that don quixote and sancho should be conducted 
to their old quarters chapter lxx which follows sixtynine and deals with matters indispensable 
for the clear comprehension of this history sancho slept that night in a cot in the same 
chamber with don quixote a thing he would have gladly excused if he could for he knew very 
well that with questions and answers his master would not let him sleep and he was in no 
humour for talking much as he still felt the pain of his late martyrdom which interfered 
with his freedom of speech and it would have been more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone 
than in that luxurious chamber in company and so well founded did his apprehension prove 
and so correct was his anticipation that scarcely had his master got into bed when he said 
what dost thou think of tonights adventure sancho great and mighty is the power of coldhearted 
scorn for thou with thine own eyes hast seen altisidora slain not by arrows nor by the sword 
nor by any warlike weapon nor by deadly poisons but by the thought of the sternness and 
scorn with which i have always treated her she might have died and welcome said sancho 
when she pleased and how she pleased and she might have left me alone for i never made her 
fall in love or scorned her i dont know nor can i imagine how the recovery of altisidora 
a damsel more fanciful than wise can have as i have said before anything to do with the sufferings 
of sancho panza now i begin to see plainly and clearly that there are enchanters and enchanted 
people in the world and may god deliver me from them since i cant deliver myself and so i 
beg of your worship to let me sleep and not ask me any more questions unless you want me to 
throw myself out of the window sleep sancho my friend said don quixote and altisidora 
has behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised and although that virtue 
of thine is gratis dataas it has cost thee no study whatever any more than such study as 
thy personal sufferings may bei can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for 
the lashes on account of the disenchant of dulcinea i would have given it to thee freely 
ere this i am not sure however whether payment will comport with the cure and i would not 
have the reward interfere with the medicine i think there will be nothing lost by trying 
it consider how much thou wouldst have sancho and whip thyself at once and pay thyself 
down with thine own hand as thou hast money of mine at this proposal sancho opened his eyes 
and his ears a palms breadth wide and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping 
himself and said he to his master very well then senor ill hold myself in readiness to gratify 
your worships wishes if im to profit by it for the love of my wife and children forces me 
to seem grasping let your worship say how much you will pay me for each lash i give myself 
if sancho replied don quixote i were to requite thee as the importance and nature of the 
cure deserves the treasures of venice the mines of potosi would be insufficient to pay 
thee see what thou hast of mine and put a price on each lash of them said sancho there are 
three thousand three hundred and odd of these i have given myself five the rest remain 
let the five go for the odd ones and let us take the three thousand three hundred which at 
a quarter real apiece for i will not take less though the whole world should bid me make 
three thousand three hundred quarter reals the three thousand are one thousand five 
hundred half reals which make seven hundred and fifty reals and the three hundred make 
a hundred and fifty half reals which come to seventyfive reals which added to the seven 
hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twentyfive reals in all these i will stop out 
of what i have belonging to your worship and ill return home rich and content though well 
whipped for theres no taking troutbut i say no more o blessed sancho o dear sancho said 
don quixote how we shall be bound to serve thee dulcinea and i all the days of our lives that 
heaven may grant us if she returns to her lost shape and it cannot be but that the ass will 
hear us and answer us if he is in the forest to which the owner of the ass replied its an excellent 
plan i declare gossip and worthy of your great genius and the two separating as agreed 
it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment and each deceived by the braying 
of the other ran to look fancying the ass had turned up at last when they came in sight of 
one another said the loser is it possible gossip that it was not my ass that brayed no it 
was i said the other well then i can tell you gossip said the asss owner that between you 
and an ass there is not an atom of difference as far as braying goes for i never in all my life 
saw or heard anything more natural those praises and compliments belong to you more justly 
than to me gossip said the inventor of the plan for by the god that made me unless thou quittest 
coach slayest thee as art here a biscayan don quixote understood him quite well and answered 
him very quietly if thou wert a knight as thou art none i should have already chastised 
thy folly and rashness miserable creature to which the biscayan returned i no gentlemani 
swear to god thou liest as i am christian if thou droppest lance and drawest sword soon 
shalt thou see thou art carrying water to the cat biscayan on land hidalgo at sea hidalgo 
at the devil and look if thou sayest otherwise thou liest you will see presently said agrajes 
replied don quixote and throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword braced his buckler 
on his arm and with his hand on his sword exclaimed o lady of beauty strength and support 
of my faint heart it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this thy captive 
knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure by this he felt himself so inspired that he 
would not have flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him the comrades 
of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance to shower stones 
on don quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to protect himself with his buckler 
and poor rocinante no more heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass sancho planted 
himself behind his ass and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured 
on both of them don quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that more pebbles than 
i could count struck him full on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground 
and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him snatched the basin from his head and 
with it struck three or four blows on his shoulders and as many more on the ground knocking 
it almost to pieces they then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his armour and they 
would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves had not prevented them from sancho 
they took his coat leaving him in his shirtsleeves and dividing among themselves the 
remaining spoils of the battle they went each one his own way more solicitous about keeping 
clear of the holy brotherhood they dreaded than about burdening themselves with the 
chain or going to present themselves before the lady dulcinea del toboso the daughter 
of lorenzo corchuelo with whom he was over head and ears in love they were both amazed at 
what sancho panza told them for though they were aware of don quixotes madness and the 
nature of it each time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder they then asked 
sancho panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady dulcinea del toboso he 
said it was written in a notebook and that his masters directions were that he should have 
it copied on paper at the first village he came to on this the curate said if he showed it 
to him he himself would make a fair copy of it sancho put his hand into his bosom in search 
of the notebook but could not find it nor if he had been searching until now could he have 
found it for don quixote had kept it and had never given it to him nor had he himself thought 
of asking for it when sancho discovered he could not find the book his face grew deadly 
pale and in great haste he again felt his body all over and seeing plainly it was not to be 
found without more ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it and 
then as quick as he could and without stopping gave himself half a dozen cuffs on the face 
and nose till they were bathed in blood seeing this the curate and the barber asked him 
what had happened him that he gave himself such rough treatment what should happen me 
replied sancho but to have lost from one hand to the other in a moment three asscolts each 
of them like a castle how is that said the barber i have lost the notebook said sancho that 
contained the letter to dulcinea and an order signed by my master in which he directed 
his niece to give me three asscolts out of four or five he had at home and he then told them 
about the loss of dapple the curate consoled him telling him that when his master was found 
he would get him to renew the order and make a fresh draft on paper as was usual and customary 
for those made in notebooks were never accepted or honoured sancho comforted himself 
with this and said if that were so the loss of dulcineas letter did not trouble him much 
for he had it almost by heart and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they 
liked repeat it then sancho said the barber and we will write it down afterwards sancho 
panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to his memory and balanced himself 
now on one foot now the other one moment staring at the ground the next at the sky and after 
having half gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him to begin 
he said after a long pause by god senor licentiate devil a thing can i recollect of the letter 
but it said at the beginning exalted and scrubbing lady it cannot have said scrubbing 
said the barber but superhuman or sovereign that is it said sancho then as well as i remember 
it went on the wounded and wanting of sleep and the pierced kisses your worships hands 
ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one and it said something or other about health 
and sickness that he was sending her and from that it went tailing off until it ended with 
yours till death the knight of the rueful countenance i cannot endure or bear with patience 
some of the things that your worship says and from them i begin to suspect that all you tell 
me about chivalry and winning kingdoms and empires and giving islands and bestowing 
other rewards and dignities after the custom of knightserrant must be all made up of wind 
and lies and all pigments or figments or whatever we may call them for what would anyone 
think that heard your worship calling a barbers basin mambrinos helmet without ever 
seeing the mistake all this time but that one who says and maintains such things must have 
his brains addled i have the basin in my sack all dinted and i am taking it home to have it 
mended to trim my beard in it if by gods grace i am allowed to see my wife and children some 
day or other look here sancho said don quixote if thou hadst not introduced some bit of 
a proverb into thy speech well well i forgive thee provided thou dost mend and not show 
thyself in future so fond of thine own interest but try to be of good cheer and take heart 
and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of my promises which by being 
delayed does not become impossible sancho said he would do so and keep up his heart as best 
he could they then entered the grove and don quixote settled himself at the foot of an elm 
and sancho at that of a beech for trees of this kind and others like them always have feet 
but no hands sancho passed the night in pain for with the evening dews the blow of the staff 
made itself felt all the more don quixote passed it in his neverfailing meditations but 
for all that they had some winks of sleep and with the appearance of daylight they pursued 
their journey in quest of the banks of the famous ebro where that befell them which will 
be told in the following chapter chapter xxix of the famous adventure of the enchanted 
bark by stages as already described or left undescribed two days after quitting the grove 
don quixote and sancho reached the river ebro and the sight of it was a great delight to 
don quixote as he contemplated and gazed upon the charms of its banks the clearness of 
its stream the gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters and the 
pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind above all he dwelt upon what 
he had seen in the cave of montesinos to his two illustrious hearers and he began as follows 
a matter of some twelve or fourteen times a mans height down in this pit on the righthand 
side there is a recess or space roomy enough to contain a large cart with its mules a little 
light reaches it through some chinks or crevices communicating with it and open to the 
surface of the earth this recess or space i perceived when i was already growing weary 
and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the rope travelling downwards 
into that dark region without any certainty or knowledge of where i was going so i resolved 
to enter it and rest myself for a while i called out telling you not to let out more rope until 
i bade you but you cannot have heard me i then gathered in the rope you were sending me and 
making a coil or pile of it i seated myself upon it ruminating and considering what i was 
to do to lower myself to the bottom having no one to hold me up and as i was thus deep in thought 
and perplexity suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell upon me and when 
i least expected it i know not how i awoke and found myself in the midst of the most beautiful 
delightful meadow that nature could produce or the most lively human imagination conceive 
i opened my eyes i rubbed them and found i was not asleep but thoroughly awake nevertheless 
i felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was i myself who was there or some 
empty delusive phantom but touch feeling the collected thoughts that passed through 
my mind all convinced me that i was the same then and there that i am this moment next there 
presented itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle with walls that seemed built 
of clear transparent crystal and through two great doors that opened wide therein i saw 
coming forth and advancing towards me a venerable old man clad in a long gown of mulberrycoloured 
serge that trailed upon the ground on his shoulders and breast he had a green satin collegiate 
hood and covering his head a black milanese bonnet and his snowwhite beard fell below 
his girdle he carried no arms whatever nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fairsized 
filberts each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg his bearing his gait his dignity 
and imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering he approached me and the first 
thing he did was to make don quixote take off his armour and lead him in that tight chamois 
suit we have already described and depicted more than once out on a balcony overhanging 
one of the chief streets of the city in full view of the crowd and of the boys who gazed at 
him as they would at a monkey the cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though 
it were for him alone and not to enliven the festival of the day that they wore it and sancho 
was in high delight for it seemed to him that how he knew not he had fallen upon another camachos 
wedding another house like don diego de mirandas another castle like the dukes some of 
don antonios friends dined with him that day and all showed honour to don quixote and treated 
him as a knighterrant and he becoming puffed up and exalted in consequence could not contain 
himself for satisfaction such were the drolleries of sancho that all the servants of 
the house and all who heard him were kept hanging upon his lips while at table don antonio 
said to him we hear worthy sancho that you are so fond of manjar blanco and forcedmeat balls 
that if you have any left you keep them in your bosom for the next day no senor thats not true 
said sancho for i am more cleanly than greedy and my master don quixote here knows well 
that we two are used to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts to be sure if it so happens 
that they offer me a heifer i run with a halter i mean i eat what im given and make use of opportunities 
as i find them but whoever says that im an outoftheway eater or not cleanly let me tell him 
that he is wrong and id put it in a different way if i did not respect the honourable beards 
that are at the table indeed said don quixote sanchos moderation and cleanliness in eating 
might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages 
to come it is true that when he is hungry there is a certain appearance of voracity about 
him for he eats at a great pace and chews with both jaws but cleanliness he is always mindful 
of and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily so much so that he eats grapes 
and even pomegranate pips with a fork what said don antonio has sancho been a governor 
ay said sancho and of an island called barataria i governed it to perfection for ten days 
and lost my rest all the time and learned to look down upon all the governments in the world 
you came out of your mothers womb without a government you have lived until now without 
a government and when it is gods will you will go or be carried to your grave without a government 
how many there are in the world who live without a government and continue to live all the 
same and are reckoned in the number of the people the best sauce in the world is hunger and 
as the poor are never without that they always eat with a relish but mind sancho if by good 
luck you should find yourself with some government dont forget me and your children remember 
that sanchico is now full fifteen and it is right he should go to school if his uncle the 
abbot has a mind to have him trained for the church consider too that your daughter marisancha 
will not die of grief if we marry her for i have my suspicions that she is as eager to get a 
husband as you to get a government and after all a daughter looks better ill married than 
well whored by my faith replied sancho if god brings me to get any sort of a government i 
intend wife to make such a high match for marisancha that there will be no approaching 
her without calling her my lady nay sancho returned teresa marry her to her equal that 
is the safest plan for if you put her out of wooden clogs into highheeled shoes out of her 
grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns out of the plain marica and thou into 
dona soandso and my lady the girl wont know where she is and at every turn she will fall into 
a thousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun stuff tut you fool 
said sancho it will be only to practise it for two or three years and then dignity and decorum 
will fit her as easily as a glove and if not what matter let her he my lady and never mind what 
happens keep to your own station sancho replied teresa dont try to raise yourself higher 
and bear in mind the proverb that says wipe the nose of your neigbbours son and take him 
into your house a fine thing it would be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads 
every moment with everyone who called them by that nameor the cazoleros berengeneros 
ballenatos jaboneros or the bearers of all the other names and titles that are always 
in the mouth of the boys about the streets its subject is the release by senor don gaiferos 
of his wife melisendra when a captive in spain at the hands of the moors in the city of sansuena 
for so they called then what is now called saragossa and there you may see how don gaiferos 
is playing at the tables just as they sing it at tables playing don gaiferos sits for melisendra 
is forgotten now and that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and a sceptre 
in his hand is the emperor charlemagne the supposed father of melisendra who angered 
to see his soninlaws inaction and unconcern comes in to chide him and observe with what 
vehemence and energy he chides him so that you would fancy he was going to give him half 
a dozen raps with his sceptre and indeed there are authors who say he did give them and sound 
ones too and after having said a great deal to him about imperilling his honour by not effecting 
the release of his wife he said so the tale runs enough ive said see to it now observe too 
how the emperor turns away and leaves don gaiferos fuming and you see now how in a burst 
of anger he flings the table and the board far from him and calls in haste for his armour 
and asks his cousin don roland for the loan of his sword durindana and how don roland refuses 
to lend it offering him his company in the difficult enterprise he is undertaking but 
he in his valour and anger will not accept it and says that he alone will suffice to rescue 
his wife even though she were imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth and with this he 
retires to arm himself and set out on his journey at once now let your worships turn your 
eyes to that tower that appears there which is supposed to be one of the towers of the alcazar 
of saragossa now called the aljaferia that lady who appears on that balcony dressed in 
moorish fashion is the peerless melisendra for many a time she used to gaze from thence 
upon the road to france and seek consolation in her captivity by thinking of paris and 
her husband observe too a new incident which now occurs such as perhaps never was seen 
do you not see that moor who silently and stealthily with his finger on his lip approaches 
melisendra from behind observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips and what a hurry she 
is in to spit and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock and how she bewails herself 
and tears her fair hair as though it were to blame for the wrong observe too that the stately 
moor who is in that corridor is king marsilio of sansuena who having seen the moors insolence 
at once orders him though his kinsman and a great favourite of his to be seized and given 
two hundred lashes while carried through the streets of the city according to custom 
with criers going before him and officers of justice behind and here you see them come 
out to execute the sentence although the offence has been scarcely committed for among 
the moors there are no indictments nor remands as with us here don quixote called out child 
child go straight on with your story and dont run into curves and slants for to establish 
a fact clearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation and said master pedro 
from within boy stick to your text and do as the gentleman bids you its the best plan keep 
to your plain song and dont attempt harmonies for they are apt to break down from being 
over fine i will said the boy and he went on to say this figure that you see here on horseback 
covered with a gascon cloak is don gaiferos himself whom his wife now avenged of the insult 
of the amorous moor and taking her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and more 
tranquil countenance has perceived without recognising him and she addresses her husband 
supposing him to be some traveller and holds with him all that conversation and colloquy 
in the ballad that runs if you sir knight to france are bound oh for gaiferos ask which i 
do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust suffice it to observe how don gaiferos 
discovers himself and that by her joyful gestures melisendra shows us she has recognised 
him and what is more we now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the 
haunches of her good husbands horse but ah unhappy lady the edge of her petticoat has caught 
on one of the bars of the balcony and she is left hanging in the air unable to reach the ground 
finding himself in this position and that the green coat was beginning to tear and reflecting 
that if the fierce animal came that way he might be able to get at him he began to utter such 
cries and call for help so earnestly that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure 
he must be in the teeth of some wild beast in the end the tusked boar fell pierced by the blades 
of the many spears they held in front of him and don quixote turning round at the cries of 
sancho for he knew by them that it was he saw him hanging from the oak head downwards with 
dapple who did not forsake him in his distress close beside him and cide hamete observes 
that he seldom saw sancho panza without seeing dapple or dapple without seeing sancho 
panza such was their attachment and loyalty one to the other don quixote went over and 
unhooked sancho who as soon as he found himself in his armour exclaimed let us be gone in 
the name of god to bring aid to this great lady the barber was all this time on his knees at 
great pains to hide his laughter and not let his beard fall for had it fallen maybe their 
fine scheme would have come to nothing but now seeing the boon granted and the promptitude 
with which don quixote prepared to set out in compliance with it he rose and took his ladys 
hand and between them they placed her upon the mule don quixote then mounted rocinante 
and the barber settled himself on his beast sancho being left to go on foot which made him 
feel anew the loss of his dapple finding the want of him now but he bore all with cheerfulness 
being persuaded that his master had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming 
an emperor for he felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess and be king of micomicon 
at least the only thing that troubled him was the reflection that this kingdom was in the 
land of the blacks and that the people they would give him for vassals would be all black 
but for this he soon found a remedy in his fancy and said he to himself what is it to me if my 
vassals are blacks what more have i to do than make a cargo of them and carry them to spain 
where i can sell them and get ready money for them and with it buy some title or some office 
in which to live at ease all the days of my life not unless you go to sleep and havent the wit 
or skill to turn things to account and sell three six or ten thousand vassals while you 
would be talking about it by god i will stir them up big and little or as best i can and let 
them be ever so black ill turn them into white or yellow come come what a fool i am and so he 
jogged on so occupied with his thoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about the 
hardship of travelling on foot cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among 
some bushes not knowing how to join company with the others but the curate who was very 
fertile in devices soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose and with a pair of scissors 
he had in a case he quickly cut off cardenios beard and putting on him a grey jerkin of his 
own he gave him a black cloak leaving himself in his breeches and doublet while cardenios 
appearance was so different from what it had been that he would not have known himself 
had he seen himself in a mirror having effected this although the others had gone on ahead 
while they were disguising themselves they easily came out on the high road before them 
for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not allow those on horseback 
to go as fast as those on foot they then posted themselves on the level ground at the outlet 
of the sierra and as soon as don quixote saw him he asked him can you tell me worthy friend 
and god speed you whereabouts here is the palace of the peerless princess dona dulcinea 
del toboso senor replied the lad i am a stranger and i have been only a few days in the town 
doing farm work for a rich farmer in that house opposite there live the curate of the village 
and the sacristan and both or either of them will be able to give your worship some account 
of this lady princess for they have a list of all the people of el toboso though it is my belief 
there is not a princess living in the whole of it many ladies there are of quality and in 
her own house each of them may be a princess well then she i am inquiring for will be one of 
these my friend said don quixote may be so replied the lad god be with you for here comes 
the daylight and without waiting for any more of his questions he whipped on his mules 
sancho seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied said to him senor daylight 
will be here before long and it will not do for us to let the sun find us in the street it will 
be better for us to stay quiet and let every jade mind her spinning and let us go to dinner 
good god what was the indignation of don quixote when he heard the lament and learned the 
cause consoled sancho with the best arguments he could entreating him to be patient and 
promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five asscolts that he 
had at home to be given to him sancho took comfort at this dried his tears suppressed his 
sobs and returned thanks for the kindness shown him by don quixote he on his part was rejoiced 
to the heart on entering the mountains as they seemed to him to run extravagantly high 
he established a fixed rate for servants wages which were becoming recklessly exorbitant 
he laid extremely heavy penalties upon those who sang lewd or loose songs either by day 
or night he decreed that no blind man should sing of any miracle in verse unless he could 
produce authentic evidence that it was true for it was his opinion that most of those the 
blind men sing are trumped up to the detriment of the true ones he established and created 
an alguacil of the poor not to harass them but to examine them and see whether they really 
were so for many a sturdy thief or drunkard goes about under cover of a makebelieve crippled 
limb or a sham sore in a word he made so many good rules that to this day they are preserved 
there and are called the constitutions of the great governor sancho panza chapter lii 
wherein is related the adventure of the second distressed or afflicted duenna otherwise 
called dona rodriguez chapter liii of the troublous end and termination sancho panzas 
government came to to fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for 
ever in the same state is an idle fancy on the contrary in it everything seems to go in a circle 
i mean round and round the spring succeeds the summer the summer the fall the fall the autumn 
the autumn the winter and the winter the spring and so time rolls with neverceasing wheel 
mans life alone swifter than time speeds onward to its end without any hope of renewal 
save it be in that other life which is endless and boundless thus saith cide hamete the 
mahometan philosopher for there are many that by the light of nature alone without the 
light of faith have a comprehension of the fleeting nature and instability of this present 
life and the endless duration of that eternal life we hope for but our author is here speaking 
of the rapidity with which sanchos government came to an end melted away disappeared 
vanished as it were in smoke and shadow for as he lay in bed on the night of the seventh day 
of his government sated not with bread and wine but with delivering judgments and giving 
opinions and making laws and proclamations just as sleep in spite of hunger was beginning 
to close his eyelids he heard such a noise of bellringing and shouting that one would have 
fancied the whole island was going to the bottom he sat up in bed and remained listening 
intently to try if he could make out what could be the cause of so great an uproar not only 
however was he unable to discover what it was but as countless drums and trumpets now helped 
to swell the din of the bells and the squalling of the cats that though the duke and duchess 
were the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it while don quixote stood paralysed 
with fear and as luck would have it two or three of the cats made their way in through the 
grating of his chamber and flying from one side to the other he shall declare on oath where 
he is going to and with what object and if he swears truly he shall be allowed to pass but 
if falsely he shall be put to death for it by hanging on the gallows erected there without 
any remission though the law and its severe penalty were known many persons crossed but 
in their declarations it was easy to see at once they were telling the truth and the judges 
let them pass free it happened however that one man when they came to take his declaration 
swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there 
and nothing else the judges held a consultation over the oath and they said if we let this 
man pass free he has sworn falsely and by the law he ought to die but if we hang him as he swore 
he was going to die on that gallows and therefore swore the truth by the same law he ought 
to go free it is asked of your worship senor governor what are the judges to do with this 
man for they are still in doubt and perplexity and having heard of your worships acute 
and exalted intellect they have sent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give 
your opinion on this very intricate and puzzling case to this sancho made answer indeed 
those gentlemen the judges that send you to me might have spared themselves the trouble 
for i have more of the obtuse than the acute in me but repeat the case over again so that i 
may understand it and then perhaps i may be able to hit the point the querist repeated again 
and again what he had said before and then sancho said it seems to me i can set the matter 
right in a moment and in this way the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows but 
if he dies upon it he has sworn the truth and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass 
over the bridge but if they dont hang him then he has sworn falsely and by the same law deserves 
to be hanged it is as the senor governor says said the messenger and as regards a complete 
comprehension of the case there is nothing left to desire or hesitate about well then 
i say said sancho that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly and 
hang the part that has lied and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied 
with but then senor governor replied the querist the man will have to be divided into two 
parts and if he is divided of course he will die and so none of the requirements of the law 
will be carried out and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it look here my good sir 
said sancho either im a numskull or else there is the same reason for this passenger dying 
as for his living and passing over the bridge for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally 
condemns him and that being the case it is my opinion you should not stir a step who bade 
thee meddle in this sancho said don quixote who senor said sancho i meddle for i have a right 
to meddle as a squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your worship 
the most courteous and bestbred knight in the whole world of courtliness and in these 
things as i have heard your worship say as much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few 
and to one who has his ears open few words sancho is right said the duke well see what the 
countess is like and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her and now the drums and 
fife made their entrance as before and here the author brought this short chapter to an 
end and began the next following up the same adventure which is one of the most notable 
in the history chapter xxxviii wherein is told the distressed duennas tale of her misfortunes 
following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as twelve duennas 
in two lines all dressed in ample mourning robes apparently of milled serge with hoods 
of fine white gauze so long that they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen behind 
them came the countess trifaldi the squire trifaldin of the white beard we heard of the 
misfortune of my lady the countess trifaldi whom the enchanters have caused to be called 
the distressed duenna bid her enter o stupendous squire and tell her that the valiant 
knight don quixote of la mancha at the question a young girl who was washing stood up and 
said teresa panza is my mother and that sancho is my father and that knight is our master 
well then miss said the page come and show me where your mother is for i bring her a letter 
and a present from your father that i will with all my heart senor said she and executed 
the order with great delight this said the barber is the knight platir an old book that 
said the curate but i find no reason for clemency in it send it after the others without 
appeal which was done another book was opened and they saw it was entitled the knight of 
the cross for the sake of the holy name this book has said the curate its ignorance might 
be excused but then they say behind the cross theres the devil i dont deny it said sancho 
so for the present give me a piece of bread and four pounds or so of grapes no poison can come 
in them for the fact is i cant go on without eating and if we are to be prepared for these battles 
that are threatening us we must be well provisioned for it is the tripes that carry the 
heart and not the heart the tripes and you secretary answer my lord the duke and tell him 
that all his commands shall be obeyed to the letter as he directs and say from me to my lady 
the duchess that i kiss her hands and that i beg of her not to forget to send my letter and 
bundle to my wife teresa panza by a messenger and i will take it as a great favour and if he 
does not give it to me i was born like everyone else and a man must not live in dependence 
on anyone except god and what is more my bread will taste as well and perhaps even better 
without a government than if i were a governor and how do i know but that in these governments 
the devil may have prepared some trip for me to make me lose my footing and fall and knock 
my grinders out sancho i was born and sancho i mean to die but for all that if heaven were 
to make me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind without much trouble and 
without much risk i am not such a fool as to refuse it for they say too when they offer thee 
a heifer run with a halter when they offer thee a government take it when they would give 
thee a county seize it when they say here here to thee with something good swallow it oh 
no go to sleep and dont answer the strokes of good fortune and the lucky chances that are 
knocking at the door of your house and what do i care added sanchica whether anybody says 
when he sees me holding my head up the dog saw himself in hempen breeches and the rest of 
it hearing this the curate said i do believe that all this family of the panzas are born 
with a sackful of proverbs in their insides every one of them i never saw one of them that 
does not pour them out at all times and on all occasions that is true said the page for senor 
governor sancho utters them at every turn and though a great many of them are not to the 
purpose still they amuse one and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them highly then 
you still maintain that all this about sanchos government is true senor said the bachelor 
and that there actually is a duchess who sends him presents and writes to him because we 
although we have handled the present and read the letters dont believe it and suspect 
it to be something in the line of our fellowtownsman don quixote who fancies that everything 
is done by enchantment and for this reason i am almost ready to say that id like to touch 
and feel your worship to see whether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man 
of flesh and blood all i know sirs replied the page is that i am a real ambassador and that 
senor sancho panza is governor as a matter of fact and that my lord and lady the duke and 
duchess can give and have given him this same government and that i have heard the said 
sancho panza bears himself very stoutly therein whether there be any enchantment in 
all this or not it is for your worships to settle between you for thats all i know by the oath 
i swear and that is by the life of my parents whom i have still alive and love dearly it may 
be so said the bachelor but dubitat augustinus doubt who will said the page what i have 
told you is the truth and that will always rise above falsehood as oil above water if not 
operibus credite et non verbis let one of you come with me and he will see with his eyes what 
he does not believe with his ears its for me to make that trip said sanchica take me with 
you senor behind you on your horse for ill go with all my heart to see my father governors 
daughters said the page must not travel along the roads alone but accompanied by coaches 
and litters and a great number of attendants by god said sanchica i can go just as well mounted 
on a sheass as in a coach what a dainty lass you must take me for hush girl said teresa you 
dont know what youre talking about the gentleman is quite right for as the time so the behaviour 
when it was sancho it was sancha when it is governor its senora i dont know if im right senora 
teresa says more than she is aware of said the page and now give me something to eat or else 
take your government for a trade that does not feed its master is not worth two beans the 
doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion and he would have made a tirteafuera 
out of the room but that the same instant a posthorn sounded in the street and the carver 
putting his head out of the window turned round and said its a courier from my lord the duke 
no doubt with some despatch of importance the courier came in all sweating and flurried 
and taking a paper from his bosom placed it in the governors hands sancho handed it to the 
majordomo and bade him read the superscription which ran thus to don sancho panza governor 
of the island of barataria into his own hands or those of his secretary sancho when he heard 
this said which of you is my secretary i am senor said one of those present for i can read 
and write and am a biscayan with that addition said sancho you might be secretary to the 
emperor himself open this paper and see what it says the newborn secretary obeyed and 
having read the contents said the matter was one to be discussed in private sancho ordered 
the chamber to be cleared the majordomo and the carver only remaining so the doctor and 
the others withdrew and then the secretary read the letter which was as follows it has 
come to my knowledge senor don sancho panza that certain enemies of mine and of the island 
are about to make a furious attack upon it some night i know not when it behoves you to be 
on the alert and keep watch that they surprise you not i also know by trustworthy spies 
that four persons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life because 
they stand in dread of your great capacity keep your eyes open and take heed who approaches 
you to address you and eat nothing that is presented to you i will take care to send you aid 
if you find yourself in difficulty but in all things you will act as may be expected of your 
judgment from this place the sixteenth of august at four in the morning your friend the 
duke sancho was astonished and those who stood by made believe to be so too and turning 
to the majordomo he said to him what we have got to do first and it must be done at once is to 
put doctor recio in the lockup for if anyone wants to kill me it is he and by a slow death and 
the worst of all which is hunger likewise said the carver it is my opinion your worship 
should not eat anything that is on this table for the whole was a present from some nuns 
and as they say behind the cross theres the devil to the fire with it taking down another 
book the barber said this is the mirror of chivalry i know his worship said the curate that 
is where senor reinaldos of montalvan figures with his friends and comrades greater 
thieves than cacus and the twelve peers of france with the veracious historian turpin 
however i am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment because at any 
rate they have some share in the invention of the famous matteo boiardo whence too the 
christian poet ludovico ariosto wove his web to whom if i find him here and speaking any 
language but his own i shall show no respect whatever but if he speaks his own tongue i will 
put him upon my head well i have him in italian said the barber but i do not understand him 
nor would it be well that you should understand him said the curate and on that score we 
might have excused the captain if he had not brought him into spain and turned him into 
castilian he robbed him of a great deal of his natural force and so do all those who try to 
turn books written in verse into another language for with all the pains they take and 
all the cleverness they show they never can reach the level of the originals as they were 
first produced in short i say that this book and all that may be found treating of those 
french affairs should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well until after more consideration 
it is settled what is to be done with them excepting always one bernardo del carpio that 
is going about and another called roncesvalles for these if they come into my hands shall 
pass at once into those of the housekeeper and from hers into the fire without any reprieve 
to all this the barber gave his assent and looked upon it as right and proper being persuaded 
that the curate was so staunch to the faith and loyal to the truth that he would not for the 
world say anything opposed to them opening another book he saw it was palmerin de oliva 
and beside it was another called palmerin of england seeing which the licentiate said 
let the olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes even are left and let 
that palm of england be kept and preserved as a thing that stands alone and let such another 
case be made for it as that which alexander found among the spoils of darius and set aside 
for the safe keeping of the works of the poet homer this book gossip is of authority for 
two reasons first because it is very good and secondly because it is said to have been written 
by a wise and witty king of portugal all the adventures at the castle of miraguarda are 
excellent and of admirable contrivance and the language is polished and clear studying 
and observing the style befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment so then provided 
it seems good to you master nicholas i say let this and amadis of gaul be remitted the penalty 
of fire and as for all the rest let them perish without further question or query nay gossip 
said the barber for this that i have here is the famous don belianis well said the curate 
that and the second third and fourth parts all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge 
their excess of bile and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the castle of fame 
and other greater affectations to which end let them be allowed the overseas term and 
according as they mend so shall mercy or justice be meted out to them and in the mean time 
gossip do you keep them in your house and let no one read them with all my heart said the gentleman 
that on the goletta runs thus chapter xl in which the story of the captive is continued 
sonnet blest souls that from this mortal husk set free in guerdon of brave deeds beatified 
above this lowly orb of ours abide made heirs of heaven and immortality with noble rage 
and ardour glowing ye your strength while strength was yours in battle plied and with 
your own blood and the foemans dyed the sandy soil and the encircling sea it was the ebbing 
lifeblood first that failed the weary arms the stout hearts never quailed though vanquished 
yet ye earned the victors crown though mourned yet still triumphant was your fall for 
there ye won between the sword and wall in heaven glory and on earth renown that is it exactly 
according to my recollection said the captive well then that on the fort said the gentleman 
if my memory serves me goes thus sonnet up from this wasted soil this shattered shell whose 
walls and towers here in ruin lie three thousand soldier souls took wing on high in the 
bright mansions of the blest to dwell the onslaught of the foeman to repel by might of arm 
all vainly did they try and when at length twas left them but to die wearied and few the last 
defenders fell and this same arid soil hath ever been a haunt of countless mournful memories 
as well in our day as in days of yore but never yet to heaven it sent i ween from its hard bosom 
purer souls than these or braver bodies on its surface bore the sonnets were not disliked 
and the captive was rejoiced at the tidings they gave him of his comrade and continuing 
his tale he went on to say the goletta and the fort being thus in their hands the turks gave 
orders to dismantle the golettafor the fort was reduced to such a state that there was 
nothing left to leveland to do the work more quickly and easily they mined it in three places 
but nowhere were they able to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong that is 
to say the old walls while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that the 
fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease finally the fleet returned victorious 
and triumphant to constantinople and a few months later died my master el uchali otherwise 
uchali fartax which means in turkish the scabby renegade for that he was it is the practice 
with the turks to name people from some defect or virtue they may possess the reason being 
that there are among them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their descent 
from the ottoman house and the others as i have said take their names and surnames either 
from bodily blemishes or moral qualities this scabby one rowed at the oar as a slave of 
the grand signors for fourteen years and when over thirtyfour years of age in resentment 
at having been struck by a turk while at the oar turned renegade and renounced his faith 
in order to be able to cure him when he falls sick the chief thing i have to do is to attend 
at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to be fit for him and keep 
from him what i think will do him harm and be injurious to his stomach and therefore i ordered 
that plate of fruit to be removed as being too hot and containing many spices that stimulate 
thirst for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists 
well then said sancho that dish of roast partridges there that seems so savoury will not 
do me any harm to this the physician replied of those my lord the governor shall not eat 
so long as i live why so said sancho because replied the doctor our master hippocrates 
the polestar and beacon of medicine says in one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala 
perdicis autem pessima which means all repletion is bad but that of partridge is the worst 
of all in that case said sancho let senor doctor see among the dishes that are on the table 
what will do me most good and least harm and let me eat it without tapping it with his stick 
for by the life of the governor and so may god suffer me to enjoy it but im dying of hunger 
and in spite of the doctor and all he may say to deny me food is the way to take my life instead 
of prolonging it your worship is right senor governor said the physician and therefore 
your worship i consider should not eat of those stewed rabbits there because it is a furry 
kind of food if that veal were not roasted and served with pickles you might try it but it 
is out of the question that big dish that is smoking farther off said sancho seems to me 
to be an olla podrida and out of the diversity of things in such ollas i cant fail to light 
upon something tasty and good for me absit said the doctor far from us be any such base thought 
there is nothing in the world more delightful than to be a person of consideration squire 
to a knighterrant and a seeker of adventures to be sure most of those one finds do not end 
as pleasantly as one could wish for out of a hundred ninetynine will turn out cross and 
contrary i know it by experience for out of some i came blanketed and out of others belaboured 
still for all that it is a fine thing to be on the lookout for what may happen crossing mountains 
searching woods climbing rocks visiting castles putting up at inns all at free quarters 
and devil take the maravedi to pay while this conversation passed between sancho panza 
and his wife teresa cascajo held the above irrelevant conversation don quixotes niece 
and housekeeper were not idle for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their 
uncle and master meant to give them the slip the third time and once more betake himself 
to his for them illerrant chivalry they strove by all the means in their power to cheer 
him up the bachelor bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life for which 
he himself he said had already composed an eclogue that would take the shine out of all 
sannazaro had ever written and had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard the 
flock one called barcino and the other butron which a herdsman of quintanar had sold him 
but for all this don quixote could not shake off his sadness his friends called in the doctor 
who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied with it and said that in any case it would 
be well for him to attend to the health of his soul as that of his body was in a bad way don quixote 
heard this calmly but not so his housekeeper his niece and his squire who fell weeping 
bitterly as if they had him lying dead before them the doctors opinion was that melancholy 
and depression were bringing him to his end don quixote begged them to leave him to himself 
as he had a wish to sleep a little they obeyed and he slept at one stretch as the saying is 
more than six hours so that the housekeeper and niece thought he was going to sleep for 
ever but at the end of that time when the bano was as it generally was empty it appeared with 
the cloth so bulky that it promised a happy birth reed and cloth came down to me and i found 
another paper and a hundred crowns in gold without any other coin the renegade was present 
and in our cell we gave him the paper to read which was to this effect i cannot think of a plan 
senor for our going to spain nor has lela marien shown me one though i have asked her all 
that can be done is for me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window with it ransom 
yourself and your friends and let one of you go to the land of the christians because she 
loves thee entreat her that she be pleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command 
she gives thee for she will such is her goodness on my own part and on that of all these christians 
who are with me i promise to do all that we can for thee even to death fail not to write to me 
and inform me what thou dost mean to do and i will always answer thee for the great allah 
has given us a christian captive who can speak and write thy language well as thou mayest 
see by this paper without fear therefore thou canst inform us of all thou wouldst as to 
what thou sayest that if thou dost reach the land of the christians thou wilt be my wife 
i give thee my promise upon it as a good christian and know that the christians keep their 
promises better than the moors allah and marien his mother watch over thee my lady the 
paper being written and folded i waited two days until the bano was empty as before and 
immediately repaired to the usual walk on the terrace to see if there were any sign of the 
reed which was not long in making its appearance as soon as i saw it although i could not 
distinguish who put it out i showed the paper as a sign to attach the thread but it was already 
fixed to the reed and to it i tied the paper and shortly afterwards our star once more made 
its appearance with the white flag of peace the little bundle it was dropped and i picked 
it up and found in the cloth in gold and silver coins of all sorts more than fifty crowns 
which fifty times more strengthened our joy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty 
that very night our renegade returned and said he had learned that the moor we had been 
told of lived in that house that his name was hadji morato that he was enormously rich that 
he had one only daughter the heiress of all his wealth and that it was the general opinion 
throughout the city that she was the most beautiful woman in barbary and that several 
of the viceroys who came there had sought her for a wife but that she had been always unwilling 
to marry and he had learned moreover that she had a christian slave who was now dead all 
which agreed with the contents of the paper we immediately took counsel with the renegade 
as to what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off the moorish lady and bring 
us all to christian territory and in the end it was agreed that for the present we should 
wait for a second communication from zoraida for that was the name of the asturianheld 
the light for them and while plastering him the hostess observing how full of wheals don 
quixote was in some places remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall it 
was not blows sancho said but that the rock had many points and projections and that each 
of them had left its mark pray senora he added manage to save some tow as there will be no 
want of baggage trains to travel with after that to the place of embarkation which they 
say will be carthagena i would rather have the king for a master and serve him in the wars 
than serve a court pauper and did you get any bounty now asked the cousin if i had been in 
the service of some grandee of spain or personage of distinction replied the youth i should 
have been safe to get it for that is the advantage of serving good masters that out of the 
servants hall men come to be ancients or captains or get a good pension but i to my misfortune 
always served placehunters and adventurers whose keep and wages were so miserable and 
scanty that half went in paying for the starching of ones collars it would be a miracle 
indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable bounty and tell me for heavens 
sake asked don quixote is it possible my friend that all the time you served you never got 
any livery they gave me two replied the page but just as when one quits a religious community 
before making profession they strip him of the dress of the order and give him back his 
own clothes so did my masters return me mine for as soon as the business on which they came 
to court was finished they went home and took back the liveries they had given merely for 
show what spilorceriaas an italian would say said don quixote but for all that consider 
yourself happy in having left court with as worthy an object as you have for there is nothing 
on earth more honourable or profitable than serving first of all god and then ones king 
and natural lord particularly in the profession of arms by which if not more wealth at 
least more honour is to be won than by letters as i have said many a time for though letters 
may have founded more great houses than arms still those founded by arms have i know not 
what superiority over those founded by letters and a certain splendour belonging to 
them that distinguishes them above all and bear in mind what i am now about to say to you 
for it will be of great use and comfort to you in time of trouble it is not to let your mind 
dwell on the adverse chances that may befall you for the worst of all is death and if it be 
a good death the best of all is to die they asked julius caesar the valiant roman emperor 
what was the best death he answered that which is unexpected which comes suddenly and 
unforeseen and though he answered like a pagan and one without the knowledge of the true 
god yet as far as sparing our feelings is concerned he was right for suppose you are killed 
in the first engagement or skirmish whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine what matters 
it it is only dying and all is over and according to terence a soldier shows better dead 
in battle than alive and safe in flight and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as 
he is obedient to his captains and those in command over him and remember my son that it 
is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet and that if old age should 
come upon you in this honourable calling though you may be covered with wounds and crippled 
and lame it will not come upon you without honour and that such as poverty cannot lessen 
especially now that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and disabled 
soldiers for it is not right to deal with them after the fashion of those who set free and 
get rid of their black slaves when they are old and useless and turning them out of their 
houses under the pretence of making them free make them slaves to hunger from which they 
cannot expect to be released except by death but for the present i wont say more than get 
ye up behind me on my horse as far as the inn and sup with me there and tomorrow you shall pursue 
your journey and god give you as good speed as your intentions deserve the page did not 
accept the invitation to mount though he did that to supper at the inn and here they say 
sancho said to himself god be with you for a master is it possible that a man who can say things 
so many and so good as he has said just now can say that he saw the impossible absurdities 
he reports about the cave of montesinos well well we shall see and now just as night was 
falling they reached the inn and it was not without satisfaction that sancho perceived 
his master took it for a real inn and not for a castle as usual the instant they entered don 
quixote asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds and was told that 
he was in the stable seeing to his mule which was what sancho and the cousin proceeded to 
do for their beasts giving the best manger and the best place in the stable to rocinante 
chapter xxv wherein is set down the braying adventure and the droll one of the puppetshowman 
together with the memorable divinations of the divining ape chapter xxvi wherein is 
continued the droll adventure of the puppetshowman together with other things in truth 
right good chapter xxvii wherein it is shown who master pedro and his ape were together 
with the mishap don quixote had in the braying adventure which he did not conclude as he 
would have liked or as he had expected chapter xxviii of matters that benengeli says he 
who reads them will know if he reads them with attention when the brave man flees treachery 
is manifest and it is for wise men to reserve themselves for better occasions this proved 
to be the case with don quixote who giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and the hostile 
intentions of the angry troop took to flight and without a thought of sancho or the danger 
in which he was leaving him retreated to such a distance as he thought made him safe sancho 
lying across his ass followed him as has been said and at length came up having by this time 
recovered his senses and on joining him let himself drop off dapple at rocinantes feet 
sore bruised and belaboured don quixote dismounted to examine his wounds but finding 
him whole from head to foot he said to him angrily enough in an evil hour didst thou take 
to braying sancho where hast thou learned that it is well done to mention the rope in the 
house of the man that has been hanged to the music of brays what harmonies couldst thou 
expect to get but cudgels give thanks to god sancho that they signed the cross on thee just 
now with a stick and did not mark thee per signum crucis with a cutlass im not equal to answering 
said sancho for i feel as if i was speaking through my shoulders let us mount and get away 
from this ill keep from braying but not from saying that knightserrant fly and leave their 
good squires to be pounded like privet or made meal of at the hands of their enemies he does 
not fly who retires returned don quixote for i would have thee know sancho that if the naked 
truth undisguised by flattery came to the ears of princes times would be different and 
other ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours which i hold to be the golden of these 
latter days profit by this advice sancho and report to me clearly and faithfully the truth 
of what thou knowest touching what i have demanded of thee that i will do with all my heart 
senor said sancho and let us return to our village with these gentlemen who seek your good 
and there we will prepare for making another sally which may turn out more profitable 
and creditable to us thou art right sancho returned don quixote it will be wise to let the 
malign influence of the stars was overpast or until some other more sage enchanter should 
disenchant him but he was very much deceived in this conclusion for daylight had hardly 
begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback well equipped and accoutred 
with firelocks across their saddlebows they called out and knocked loudly at the gate 
of the inn he called to the host and said in a very grave and measured voice many and great 
are the favours senor alcaide that i have received in this castle of yours and i remain 
under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them all the days of my life and with 
one backstrokeswishi brought his head tumbling to the ground and so much blood gushed 
forth from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water like red wine your worship 
had better say replied sancho for i would have you know sir errant that in these little 
villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at and rest assured as i 
am that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well 
of him especially in villages that is the truth said don quixote and if i make no complaint 
of the pain it is because knightserrant are not permitted to complain of any wound even 
though their bowels be coming out through it if so said sancho i have nothing to say but 
god knows i would rather your worship complained when anything ailed you for my part i 
confess i must complain however small the ache may be unless this rule about not complaining 
extends to the squires of knightserrant also don quixote could not help laughing at his 
squires simplicity and he assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose 
just as he liked for so far he had never read of anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood 
sancho bade him remember it was dinnertime to which his master answered that he wanted 
nothing himself just then but that he might eat when he had a mind with this permission 
sancho settled himself as comfortably as he could on his beast and taking out of the alforjas 
what he had stowed away in them he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately 
and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster 
in malaga might have envied and while he went on in this way gulping down draught after 
draught he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him nor did he 
rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures however dangerous 
they might be finally they passed the night among some trees from one of which don quixote 
plucked a dry branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance and fixed on it the head he had 
removed from the broken one all that night don quixote lay awake thinking of his lady dulcinea 
in imitation of the lovers of marcela sancho panza settled himself between rocinante 
and his ass and slept not like a lover who had been discarded but like a man who had been soundly 
kicked chapter xiii in which is ended the story of the shepherdess marcela with other 
incidents bit hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east when 
five of the six goatherds came to rouse don quixote and tell him that if he was still of a 
mind to go and see the famous burial of chrysostom they would bear him company don quixote 
who desired nothing better rose and ordered sancho to saddle and pannel at once which 
he did with all despatch and with the same they all set out forthwith they had not gone a 
quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming towards them some ten 
men on horseback and four or five on foot don quixotes heart beat quick and sanchos quailed 
with fear for the persons approaching them carried lances and bucklers and were in very 
warlike guise don quixote turned to sancho and said if i could make use of my weapons and 
my promise had not tied my hands i would count this host that comes against us but cakes 
and fancy bread but perhaps it may prove something different from what we apprehend the 
men on horseback now came up and raising their lances surrounded don quixote in silence 
and pointed them at his back and breast menacing him with death one of those on foot putting 
his finger to his lips as a sign to him to be silent seized rocinantes bridle and drew him 
out of the road and the others driving sancho and dapple before them and all maintaining 
a strange silence followed in the steps of the one who led don quixote the latter two or 
three times attempted to ask where they were taking him to and what they wanted but the 
instant he began to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of their 
lances and sancho fared the same way for the moment he seemed about to speak one of those 
on foot punched him with a goad and dapple likewise as if he too wanted to talk night set 
in they quickened their pace and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater especially 
as they heard themselves assailed withget on ye troglodytes silence ye barbarians march 
ye cannibals no murmuring ye scythians dont open your eyes ye murderous polyphemes ye 
bloodthirsty lions and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of 
the wretched master and man sancho went along saying to himself we tortolites barbers 
animals i dont like those names at all its in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed misfortune 
comes upon us all at once like sticks on a dog and god grant it may be somewhere where there 
are no blankets nor blanketeers nor phantoms nor enchanted moors for if there are may 
the devil take the whole concern ask that of god my son said don quixote and be not dazed 
when thou findest thyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going to seek 
happy thou above all the squires in the world bear in mind and let it not escape thy memory 
how she receives thee if she changes colour while thou art giving her my message if she 
is agitated and disturbed at hearing my name if she cannot rest upon her cushion shouldst 
thou haply find her seated in the sumptuous state chamber proper to her rank and should 
she be standing observe if she poises herself now on one foot now on the other if she repeats 
two or three times the reply she gives thee if she passes from gentleness to austerity 
from asperity to tenderness if she raises her hand to smooth her hair though it be not disarranged 
in short my son observe all her actions and motions for if thou wilt report them to me as 
they were i will gather what she hides in the recesses of her heart as regards my love for 
i would have thee know sancho if thou knowest it not that with lovers the outward actions 
and motions they give way to when their loves are in question are the faithful messengers 
that carry the news of what is going on in the depths of their hearts go my friend may better 
fortune than mine attend thee and bring thee a happier issue than that which i await in 
dread in this dreary solitude i will go and return quickly said sancho cheer up that little 
heart of yours master mine for at the present moment you seem to have got one no bigger than 
a hazel nut remember what they say that a stout heart breaks bad luck as you very well know 
to this sancho replied with an irrelevant remark which addressing merlin he made to him 
will your worship tell me senor merlinwhen that courier devil came up he gave my master 
a message from senor montesinos charging him to wait for him here as he was coming to arrange 
how the lady dona dulcinea del toboso was to be disenchanted but up to the present we have 
not seen montesinos nor anything like him to which merlin made answer the devil sancho 
is a blockhead and a great scoundrel i sent him to look for your master but not with a message 
from montesinos but from myself for montesinos is in his cave expecting or more properly 
speaking waiting for his disenchantment for theres the tail to be skinned yet said sancho 
all so far is cakes and fancy bread but if your worship wants to know all about the calumnies 
they bring against you i will fetch you one this instant who can tell you the whole of them 
without missing an atom for last night the son of bartholomew carrasco who has been studying 
at salamanca came home after having been made a bachelor and when i went to welcome him 
he told me that your worships history is already abroad in books with the title of the ingenious 
gentleman don quixote of la mancha and that he was called by way of surname the knight of 
the lions all this was greek or gibberish to the peasants but not so to the students who 
very soon perceived the crack in don quixotes pate for all that however they regarded 
him with admiration and respect and one of them said to him if you sir knight have no fixed 
road as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any let your worship come 
with us you will see one of the finest and richest weddings that up to this day have ever 
been celebrated in la mancha or for many a league round don quixote asked him if it was some 
princes that he spoke of it in this way not at all said the student it is the wedding of a farmer 
and a farmers daughter he the richest in all this country and she the fairest mortal ever 
set eyes on the display with which it is to be attended will be something rare and out of 
the common for it will be celebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride who is called 
par excellence quiteria the fair as the bridegroom is called camacho the rich she is eighteen 
and he twentytwo and they are fairly matched though some knowing ones who have all the 
pedigrees in the world by heart will have it that the family of the fair quiteria is better 
than camachos but no one minds that nowadays for wealth can solder a great many flaws at 
any rate camacho is freehanded and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadow with boughs 
and cover it in overhead so that the sun will have hard work if he tries to get in to reach 
the grass that covers the soil he has provided dancers too not only sword but also belldancers 
for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection 
of shoedancers i say nothing for of them he has engaged a host but none of these things nor 
of the many others i have omitted to mention will do more to make this a memorable wedding 
than the part which i suspect the despairing basilio will play in it this basilio is a youth 
of the same village as quiteria and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents 
of which circumstance love took advantage to reproduce to the word the longforgotten 
loves of pyramus and thisbe for basilio loved quiteria from his earliest years and she 
responded to his passion with countless modest proofs of affection so that the loves 
of the two children basilio and quiteria were the talk and the amusement of the town as 
they grew up the father of quiteria made up his mind to refuse basilio his wonted freedom 
of access to the house and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions he arranged 
a match for his daughter with the rich camacho as he did not approve of marrying her to basilio 
who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature for if the truth be told ungrudgingly 
he is the most agile youth we know a mighty thrower of the bar a firstrate wrestler and a 
great ballplayer he runs like a deer and leaps better than a goat bowls over the ninepins 
as if by magic sings like a lark plays the guitar so as to make it speak and above all handles 
a sword as well as the best for that excellence alone said don quixote at this the youth 
deserves to marry not merely the fair quiteria but queen guinevere herself were she alive 
now in spite of launcelot and all who would try to prevent it say that to my wife said sancho 
who had until now listened in silence for she wont hear of anything but each one marrying 
his equal holding with the proverb each ewe to her like what i would like is that this good 
basilio for i am beginning to take a fancy to him already should marry this lady quiteria 
and a blessing and good lucki meant to say the oppositeon people who would prevent those 
who love one another from marrying if all those who love one another were to marry said 
don quixote it would deprive parents of the right to choose and marry their children to 
the proper person and at the proper time and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands 
as they pleased one would be for choosing her fathers servant and another some one she 
has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing though he may be a drunken 
bully for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment so much wanted in choosing 
ones way of life and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error and it needs great caution 
and the special favour of heaven to make it a good one he who has to make a long journey will 
if he is wise look out for some trusty and pleasant companion to accompany him before he 
sets out why then should not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of life down 
to the final haltingplace of death more especially when the companion has to be his companion 
in bed at board and everywhere as the wife is to her husband the companionship of ones wife 
is no article of merchandise that after it has been bought may be returned or bartered 
or changed for it is an inseparable accident that lasts as long as life lasts it is a noose 
that once you put it round your neck turns into a gordian knot which if the scythe of death 
does not cut it there is no untying i could say a great deal more on this subject were i not 
prevented by the anxiety i feel to know if the senor licentiate has anything more to tell 
about the story of basilio to this the student bachelor or as don quixote called him the 
knight of the green gaban together with other matters out of the common don quixote found 
don diego de mirandas house built in village style with his arms in rough stone over the 
street door in the patio was the storeroom and at the entrance the cellar with plenty of 
winejars standing round which coming from el toboso brought back to his memory his enchanted 
and transformed dulcinea and with a sigh and not thinking of what he was saying or in whose 
presence he was he exclaimed o ye sweet treasures to my sorrow found once sweet and welcome 
when twas heavens goodwill o ye tobosan jars how ye bring back to my memory the sweet object 
of my bitter regrets the student poet don diegos son who had come out with his mother to 
receive him heard this exclamation and both mother and son were filled with amazement 
at the extraordinary figure he presented he however dismounting from rocinante advanced 
with great politeness to ask permission to kiss the ladys hand while don diego said senora 
pray receive with your wonted kindness senor don quixote of la mancha pattern and image 
wherein we see contained and condensed all that is worthy in knighterrantry don quixote 
delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception replied to him in words no less 
courteous all then proceeded to the poop which was very handsomely decorated and seated 
themselves on the bulwark benches the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all 
hands to strip which they did in an instant sancho seeing such a number of men stripped 
to the skin was taken aback and still more when he saw them spread the awning so briskly 
that it seemed to him as if all the devils were at work at it but all this was cakes and fancy 
bread to what i am going to tell now sancho was seated on the captains stage close to the 
aftermost rower on the righthand side he previously instructed in what he was to do laid 
hold of sancho hoisting him up in his arms and the whole crew who were standing ready beginning 
on the right proceeded to pass him on whirling him along from hand to hand and from bench 
to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor sanchos eyes and he made quite 
sure that the devils themselves were flying away with him nor did they leave off with him 
until they had sent him back along the left side and deposited him on the poop and the poor 
fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat and unable to comprehend what 
it was that had happened to him don quixote when he saw sanchos flight without wings asked 
the general if this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleys for the 
first time for if so as he had no intention of adopting them as a profession he had no mind 
to perform such feats of agility and if anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about 
he vowed to god he would kick his soul out and as he said this he stood up and clapped his hand 
upon his sword at this instant they struck the awning and lowered the yard with a prodigious 
rattle sancho thought heaven was coming off its hinges and going to fall on his head and 
full of terror he ducked it and buried it between his knees nor were don quixotes knees 
altogether under control for he too shook a little squeezed his shoulders together and 
lost colour the crew then hoisted the yard with the same rapidity and clatter as when they 
lowered it all the while keeping silence as though they had neither voice nor breath the 
boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor and leaping upon the middle of the gangway began 
to lay on to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash or whip and to haul out gradually 
to sea when sancho saw so many red feet for such he took the oars to be moving all together 
he said to himself its these that are the real chanted things and not the ones my master 
talks of what can those wretches have done to be so whipped and how does that one man who 
goes along there whistling dare to whip so many i declare this is hell or at least purgatory 
don quixote observing how attentively sancho regarded what was going on said to him ah 
sancho my friend how quickly and cheaply might you finish off the disenchantment of dulcinea 
if you would strip to the waist and take your place among those gentlemen amid the pain 
and sufferings of so many you would not feel your own much and moreover perhaps the sage 
merlin would allow each of these lashes being laid on with a good hand to count for ten of 
those which you must give yourself at last the general was about to ask what these lashes 
were and what was dulcineas disenchantment when a sailor exclaimed monjui signals that 
there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west on hearing this the general sprang upon 
the gangway crying now then my sons dont let her give us the slip it must be some algerine 
corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us the three others immediately came 
alongside the chief galley to receive their orders the general ordered two to put out 
to sea while he with the other kept in shore so that in this way the vessel could not escape 
them the crews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed to fly 
the two that had put out to sea after a couple of miles sighted a vessel which so far as they 
could make out they judged to be one of fourteen or fifteen banks and so she proved as soon 
as the vessel discovered the galleys she went about with the object and in the hope of making 
her escape by her speed but the attempt failed for the chief galley was one of the fastest 
vessels afloat and overhauled her so rapidly that they on board the brigantine saw clearly 
there was no possibility of escaping and the rais therefore would have had them drop their 
oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain in command of our galleys to 
anger but chance directing things otherwise so ordered it that just as the chief galley 
came close enough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from her calling on them 
to surrender two toraquis that is to say two turks both drunken that with a dozen more were 
on board the brigantine discharged their muskets killing two of the soldiers that lined 
the sides of our vessel seeing this the general swore he would not leave one of those he 
found on board the vessel alive but as he bore down furiously upon her she slipped away 
from him underneath the oars the galley shot a good way ahead those on board the vessel 
saw their case was desperate and while the galley was coming about they made sail and by 
sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off but their activity did not do them as much 
good as their rashness did them harm for the galley coming up with them in a little more 
than half a mile threw her oars over them and took the whole of them alive the other two galleys 
now joined company and all four returned with the prize to the beach where a vast multitude 
stood waiting for them eager to see what they brought back the general anchored close 
in and perceived that the viceroy of the city was on the shore he ordered the skiff to push 
off to fetch him and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of hanging forthwith the rais 
and the rest of the men taken on board the vessel about sixandthirty in number all smart 
fellows and most of them turkish musketeers he asked which was the rais of the brigantine 
and was answered in spanish by one of the prisoners who afterwards proved to be a spanish 
renegade this young man senor that you see here is our rais and he pointed to one of the handsomest 
and most gallantlooking youths that could be imagined he did not seem to be twenty years 
of age tell me dog said the general what led thee to kill my soldiers when thou sawest it 
was impossible for thee to escape is that the way to behave to chief galleys knowest thou 
not that rashness is not valour faint prospects of success should make men bold but not 
rash the rais was about to reply but the general could not at that moment listen to him as 
he had to hasten to receive the viceroy who was now coming on board the galley and with him 
certain of his attendants and some of the people you have had a good chase senor general 
said the viceroy your excellency shall soon see how good by the game strung up to this yard 
replied the general how so returned the viceroy because said the general against all 
law reason and usages of war they have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers on board 
these galleys and i have sworn to hang every man that i have taken but above all this youth 
who is the rais of the brigantine and was answered in spanish by one of the prisoners who 
afterwards proved to be a spanish renegade this young man senor that you see here is our 
rais and he pointed to one of the handsomest and most graceful youths that could be imagined 
i knew at once that they were speaking of don gaspar gregorio whose comeliness surpasses 
the most highly vaunted beauty i was troubled when i thought of the danger he was in for 
among those barbarous turks a fair youth is more esteemed than a woman be she ever so beautiful 
the king immediately ordered him to be brought before him that he might see him and asked 
me if what they said about the youth was true i then almost as if inspired by heaven told 
him it was but that i would have him to know it was not a man but a woman like myself and i entreated 
him to allow me to go and dress her in the attire proper to her so that her beauty might be 
seen to perfection and that she might present herself before him with less embarrassment 
he bade me go by all means and said that the next day we should discuss the plan to be adopted 
for my return to spain to carry away the hidden treasure i saw don gaspar i told him the danger 
he was in if he let it be seen he was a man i dressed him as a moorish woman and that same afternoon 
i brought him before the king who was charmed when he saw him and resolved to keep the damsel 
and make a present of her to the grand signor and to avoid the risk she might run among the 
women of his seraglio and distrustful of himself he commanded her to be placed in the house 
of some moorish ladies of rank who would protect and attend to her and thither he was taken 
at once what we both suffered for i cannot deny that i love him may be left to the imagination 
of those who are separated if they love one another dearly the king then arranged that 
i should return to spain in this brigantine and that two turks those who killed your soldiers 
should accompany me there also came with me this spanish renegadeand here she pointed 
to him who had first spokenwhom i know to be secretly a christian and to be more desirous 
of being left in spain than of returning to barbary the rest of the crew of the brigantine 
are moors and turks who merely serve as rowers the two turks greedy and insolent instead 
of obeying the orders we had to land me and this renegade in christian dress with which 
we came provided on the first spanish ground we came to chose to run along the coast and 
make some prize if they could fearing that if they put us ashore first we might in case of 
some accident befalling us make it known that the brigantine was at sea and thus if there 
happened to be any galleys on the coast they might be taken we sighted this shore last night 
and knowing nothing of these galleys we were discovered and the result was what you have 
seen to sum up there is don gregorio in womans dress among women in imminent danger of his 
life and here am i with hands bound in expectation or rather in dread of losing my life of 
which i am already weary here sirs ends my sad story as true as it is unhappy all i ask of you 
is what you may easily and reasonably do to show me where i may pass my life unharassed by 
the fear and dread of discovery by those who are in search of me for though the great love 
my parents bear me makes me feel sure of being kindly received by them so great is my feeling 
of shame at the mere thought that i cannot present myself before them as they expect that 
i had rather banish myself from their sight for ever than look them in the face with the 
reflection that they beheld mine stripped of that purity they had a right to expect in 
me with these words she became silent and the colour that overspread her face showed plainly 
the pain and shame she was suffering at heart in theirs the listeners felt as much pity 
as wonder at her misfortunes but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation 
and advice cardenio forestalled him saying so then senora you are the fair dorothea the 
only daughter of the rich clenardo dorothea was astonished at hearing her fathers name 
and at the miserable appearance of him who mentioned it for it has been already said how 
wretchedly clad cardenio was so she said to him and who may you be brother who seem to know 
my fathers name so well for so far if i remember rightly i have heard the curate of our village 
say that it does not become christians or sensible people to give any heed to these silly 
things and even you yourself said the same to me some time ago telling me that all christians 
who minded omens were fools but theres no need of making words about it let us push on and 
go into our village the sportsmen came up and asked for their hare which don quixote gave 
them they then went on and upon the green at the entrance of the town were filled with lights 
unaffected by the wind for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not power to stir 
the leaves on the trees the musicians were the life of the wedding wandering through the 
pleasant grounds in separate bands some dancing others singing others playing the various 
instruments already mentioned in short it seemed as though mirth and gaiety were frisking 
and gambolling all over the meadow several other persons were engaged in erecting raised 
benches from which people might conveniently see the plays and dances that were to be 
performed the next day on the spot dedicated to the celebration of the marriage of camacho 
the rich and the obsequies of basilio don quixote would not enter the village although 
the peasant as well as the bachelor pressed him he excused himself however on the grounds 
amply sufficient in his opinion that it was the custom of knightserrant to sleep in the 
fields and woods in preference to towns even were it under gilded ceilings and so turned 
aside a little out of the road very much against sanchos will as the good quarters he had 
enjoyed in the castle or house of don diego came back to his mind chapter xx wherein an account 
is given of the wedding of camacho the rich together with the incident of basilio the poor 
chapter xxi in which camachos wedding is continued with other delightful incidents 
while don quixote and sancho were shut up together they had a discussion which the history 
records with great precision and scrupulous exactness sancho said to his master senor 
what a fool i should have looked if i had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first adventure 
will be good ones by this time they had cleared the wood and saw the three village lasses 
close at hand don quixote looked all along the road to el toboso and as he could see nobody 
except the three peasant girls he was completely puzzled and asked sancho if it was outside 
the city he had left them how outside the city returned sancho are your worships eyes in 
the back of your head that you cant see that they are these who are coming here shining like 
the very sun at noonday i see nothing sancho said don quixote but three country girls on 
three jackasses now may god deliver me from the devil said sancho and can it be that your 
worship takes three hackneysor whatever theyre calledas white as the driven snow for 
jackasses by the lord i could tear my beard if that was the case well i can only say sancho 
my friend said don quixote but to enable thee to recover strength we must keep it for our 
own village for at the latest we shall get there the day after tomorrow sancho said he might 
do as he pleased but that for his own part he would like to finish off the business quickly 
before his blood cooled and while he had an appetite because in delay there is apt to be 
danger very often and praying to god and plying the hammer and that one take is better than 
two ill give thees and a sparrow in the hand than a vulture on the wing at the same time sancho 
replied don quixote if thou hadst let me attack them as i wanted at the very least the emperors 
gold crown and cupids painted wings would have fallen to thee as spoils for i should have 
taken them by force and given them into thy hands the sceptres and crowns of those playactor 
emperors said sancho were never yet pure gold but only brass foil or tin that is true said 
don quixote but i cannot conceive or make out how it is that the fear of god being the beginning 
of wisdom thou who art more afraid of a lizard than of him knowest so much pass judgment 
on your chivalries senor returned sancho and dont set yourself up to judge of other mens 
fears or braveries for i am as good a fearer of god as my neighbours but leave me to despatch 
these skimmings for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called to account for 
in the other world and so saying he began a fresh attack on the bucket with such a hearty 
appetite that he aroused don quixotes who no doubt would have helped him had he not been 
prevented by what must be told farther on chapter xxi in which camachos wedding is continued 
with other delightful incidents chapter xxii wherin is related the grand adventure 
of the cave of montesinos in the heart of la mancha which the valiant don quixote brought 
to a happy termination many and great were the attentions shown to don quixote by the newly 
married couple who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming forward in defence 
of their cause and they exalted his wisdom to the same level with his courage rating him 
as a cid in arms and a cicero in eloquence worthy sancho enjoyed himself for three days 
at the expense of the pair from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme arranged 
with the fair quiteria but a device of basilios who counted on exactly the result they 
had seen he confessed it is true that he had confided his idea to some of his friends so that 
at the proper time they might aid him in his purpose and insure the success of the deception 
that said don quixote is not and ought not to be false if thou dost pride thyself on that 
for want of which thou scornest me witness the pledge which thou didst give me and witness 
heaven which thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me and if all 
this fail thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all 
thy gaiety and vindicate the truth of what i say look at me printed in histories famed in 
arms courteous in behaviour honoured by princes courted by maidens and after all when 
i looked forward to palms triumphs and crowns won and earned by my valiant deeds i have 
this morning seen myself trampled on kicked and crushed by the feet of unclean and filthy 
animals this thought blunts my teeth paralyses my jaws cramps my hands and robs me of all 
appetite for food so much so that i have a mind to let myself die of hunger the cruelest death 
of all deaths so then said sancho munching hard all the time your worship does not agree 
with the proverb that says let martha die but let her die with a full belly i at any rate have 
no mind to kill myself so far from that i mean to do as the cobbler does who stretches the 
leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants ill stretch out my life 
by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it and let me tell you senor theres 
no greater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does take my advice and 
after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green grassmattress and you will see that 
when you awake youll feel something better don quixote did as he recommended for it struck 
him that sanchos reasoning was more like a philosophers than a blockheads and said he 
sancho if thou wilt do for me what i am going to tell now sancho was seated on the captains 
stage close to the aftermost rower on the righthand side he previously instructed in 
what he was to do laid hold of sancho hoisting him up in his arms and the whole crew who were 
standing ready beginning on the right proceeded to pass him on whirling him along from 
hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor 
sanchos eyes and he made quite sure that the devils themselves were flying away with him 
nor did they leave off with him until they had sent him back along the left side and deposited 
him on the poop and the poor fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat and 
unable to comprehend what it was that had happened to him don quixote when he saw that not 
one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his challenge was furious 
and ready to die with indignation and wrath and if he could have found in the ordinances 
of chivalry that it was lawful for a knighterrant to undertake or engage in another enterprise 
when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he had made an 
end of the one to which he was pledged he would have attacked the whole of them and would 
have made them return an answer in spite of themselves but considering that it would not 
become him nor be right to begin any new emprise until he had established micomicona in 
her kingdom he was constrained to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the 
upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers one of whom found the youth they were 
seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer without a thought of anyone coming in search 
of him much less finding him the man laid hold of him by the arm saying it becomes you well 
indeed senor don luis to be in the dress you wear and well the bed in which i find you agrees 
with the luxury in which your mother reared you the youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared 
for a while at him who held him but presently recognised him as one of his fathers servants 
at which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter a word while the 
servant went on to say there is nothing for it now senor don luis but to submit quietly and 
return home unless it is your wish that my lord your father should take his departure for 
the other world for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at your absence 
but how did my father know that i had gone this road and in this dress said don luis it was 
a student to whom you confided your intentions answered the servant that disclosed them 
touched with pity at the distress he saw your father suffer on missing you he therefore 
despatched four of his servants in quest of you and here we all are at your service better 
pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to restore you to those 
eyes that so yearn for you that shall be as i please or as heaven orders returned don luis 
what can you please or heaven order said the other except to agree to go back anything else 
is impossible all this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at 
whose side don luis lay and rising he went to report what had taken place to don fernando 
cardenio and the others who had by this time dressed themselves and told them how the man 
had addressed the youth as don and what words had passed and how he wanted him to return 
to his father which the youth was unwilling to do with this and what they already knew of 
the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him they all felt very anxious to know more 
particularly who he was and even to help him if it was attempted to employ force against 
him so they hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant dorothea 
at this instant came out of her room followed by dona clara all in a tremor and calling cardenio 
aside she told him in a few words the story of the musician and dona clara and he at the same 
time told her what had happened how his fathers servants had come in search of him but in 
telling her so he did not speak low enough but that dona clara heard what he said at which 
she was so much agitated that had not dorothea hastened to support her she would have fallen 
to the ground cardenio then bade dorothea return to her room as he would endeavour to make 
the whole matter right and they did as he desired all the four who had come in quest of don 
luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him urging him to return and console his father 
at once and without a moments delay he replied that he could not do so on any account until 
he had concluded some business in which his life honour and heart were at stake the servants 
pressed him saying that most certainly they would not return without him and that they 
would take him away whether he liked it or not you shall not do that replied don luis unless 
you take me dead though however you take me it will be without life by this time most of those 
in the inn had been attracted by the dispute but particularly cardenio don fernando his 
companions the judge the curate the barber and don quixote for he now considered there 
was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer cardenio being already 
acquainted with the young mans story asked the men who wanted to take him away what object 
they had in seeking to carry off this youth against his will our object said one of the four 
is to save the life of his father who is in danger of losing it through this gentlemans disappearance 
upon this don luis exclaimed there is no need to make my affairs public here i am free and 
i will return if i please and if not none of you shall compel me reason will compel your worship 
said the man and if it has no power over you it has power over us to make us do what we came for 
and what it is our duty to do let us hear what the whole affair is about said the judge at this 
but the man who knew him as a neighbour of theirs replied do you not know this gentleman 
senor judge he is the son of your neighbour who has run away from his fathers house in a dress 
so unbecoming his rank as your worship may perceive the judge on this looked at him more 
carefully and recognised him and embracing him said what folly is this senor don luis 
or what can have been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way and in 
this dress which so ill becomes your condition tears came into the eyes of the young man 
and he was unable to utter a word in reply but at length he said i have listened lothario 
my friend attentively as thou hast seen to what thou hast chosen to say to me and in thy arguments 
examples and comparisons i have seen that high intelligence thou dost possess and the 
perfection of true friendship thou hast reached and likewise i see and confess that if 
i am not guided by thy opinion but follow my own i am flying from the good and pursuing the 
evil this being so thou must remember that i am now labouring under that infirmity which 
women sometimes suffer from when the craving seizes them to eat clay plaster charcoal 
and things even worse disgusting to look at much more to eat so that it will be necessary 
to have recourse to some artifice to cure me and this can be easily effected if only thou 
wilt make a beginning even though it be in a lukewarm and makebelieve fashion to pay court 
to camilla who will not be so yielding that her virtue will give way at the first attack 
with this mere attempt i shall rest satisfied and thou wilt have done what our friendship 
binds thee to do not only in giving me life but in persuading me not to discard my honour 
and this thou art bound to do for one reason alone that being as i am resolved to apply this 
test it is not for thee to inquire into the difficulties in this matter smacked thou must 
be pricked thou shalt see thyself and with pinches thou must be made to howl ho i say officials 
obey my orders or by the word of an honest man ye shall see what ye were born for at this some 
six duennas advancing across the court made their appearance in procession one after 
the other four of them with spectacles and all with their right hands uplifted showing 
four fingers of wrist to make their hands look longer as is the fashion nowadays no sooner 
had sancho caught sight of them than bellowing like a bull he exclaimed i might let myself 
be handled by all the world but allow duennas to touch menot a bit of it scratch my face as 
my master was served in this very castle run me through the body with burnished daggers 
pinch my arms with redhot pincers ill bear all in patience to serve these gentlefolk but 
i wont let duennas touch me though the devil should carry me off here don quixote too broke 
silence saying to sancho have patience my son and gratify these noble persons and give 
all thanks to heaven that it has infused such virtue into thy person that by its sufferings 
thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead the duennas were now 
close to sancho and he having become more tractable and reasonable settling himself 
well in his chair presented his face and beard to the first who delivered him a smack very 
stoutly laid on and then made him a low curtsey less politeness and less paint senora duenna 
said sancho by god your hands smell of vinegarwash in fine all the duennas smacked him 
and several others of the household pinched him but what he could not stand was being pricked 
by the pins and so apparently out of patience he started up out of his chair and seizing 
a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the whole set of his tormentors 
exclaiming begone ye ministers of hell im not made of brass not to feel such outoftheway 
tortures at this instant altisidora who probably was tired of having been so long lying 
on her back turned on her side seeing which the bystanders cried out almost with one voice 
altisidora is alive altisidora lives rhadamanthus bade sancho put away his wrath as 
the object they had in view was now attained when don quixote saw altisidora move he went 
on his knees to sancho saying to him now is the time son of my bowels not to call thee my squire 
for thee to give thyself some of those lashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment 
of dulcinea now i say is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe and endowed with 
efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee to which sancho made answer thats 
trick upon trick i think and not honey upon pancakes a nice thing it would be for a whipping 
to come now on the top of pinches smacks and pinproddings you had better take a big stone 
and tie it round my neck and pitch me into a well i should not mind it much if im to be always 
made the cow of the wedding for the cure of other peoples ailments leave me alone or else 
by god ill fling the whole thing to the dogs let come what may altisidora had by this time 
sat up on the catafalque and as she did so the clarions sounded accompanied by the flutes 
and the voices of all present exclaiming long life to altisidora long life to altisidora 
the duke and duchess and the kings minos and rhadamanthus stood up and all together with 
don quixote and sancho advanced to receive her and take her down from the catafalque and 
she making as though she were recovering from a swoon bowed her head to the duke and duchess 
and made a low curtsey to sancho and now bright smiling dawn came on apace the flowers of 
the field revived raised up their heads and the crystal waters of the brooks murmuring 
over the grey and white pebbles hastened to pay their tribute to the expectant rivers 
the glad earth the unclouded sky the fresh breeze the clear light each and all showed that 
the day that came treading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright the duke and 
duchess pleased with their hunt and at having carried out their plans so cleverly and 
successfully returned to their castle resolved to follow up their joke for to them there 
was no reality that could afford them more amusement chapter xxxvi wherein is related 
the strange and undreamtof adventure of the distressed duenna alias the countess trifaldi 
together with a letter which sancho panza wrote to his wife teresa panza chapter xxxvii 
wherein is continued the notable adventure of the distressed duenna the duke and duchess 
were extremely glad to see how readily don quixote fell in with their scheme but at this 
moment sancho observed i hope this senora duenna wont be putting any difficulties in 
the way of the promise of my government for i have heard a toledo apothecary who talked 
like a goldfinch say that where duennas were mixed up nothing good could happen god bless 
me how he hated them that same apothecary and so what im thinking is if all duennas of whatever 
sort or condition they may be are plagues and busybodies what must they be that are distressed 
like this countess threeskirts or threetailsfor in my country skirts or tails tails 
or skirts its all one hush friend sancho said don quixote since this lady duenna comes 
in quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be one of those the apothecary meant moreover 
this is a countess and when countesses serve as duennas it is in the service of queens and 
empresses for in their own houses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennas 
to wait on them to this dona rodriguez who was present made answer my lady the duchess has 
duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was the will of fortune but laws go 
as kings like let nobody speak ill of duennas above all of ancient maiden ones for though 
i am not one myself i know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over one that 
is a widow but he who clipped us has kept the scissors for all that said sancho theres so 
much to be clipped about duennas so my barber said that it will be better not to stir the 
rice even though it sticks these squires returned dona rodriguez are always our enemies 
and as they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and watch us at every step whenever 
they are not saying their prayers and thats often enough they spend their time in tattling 
about us digging up our bones and burying our good name but i can tell these walking blocks 
that we will live in spite of them and in great houses too though we die of hunger and cover 
our flesh be it delicate or not with widows weeds as one covers or hides a dunghill on a procession 
day by my faith if it were permitted me and time allowed i could prove not only to those here 
present but to all the world that there is no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna i have 
no doubt said the duchess that my good dona rodriguez is right and very much so but she had 
better bide her time for fighting her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas so as 
to crush the calumny of that vile apothecary and root out the prejudice in the great sancho 
panzas mind to which sancho replied ever since i have sniffed the governorship i have 
got rid of the humours of a squire and i dont care a wild fig for all the duennas in the world 
they would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heard the notes of 
the fife and drums once more from which they concluded that the distressed duenna was 
making her entrance the duchess asked the duke if it would be proper to go out to receive 
her as she was a countess and a person of rank in respect of her being a countess said sancho 
before the duke could reply i am for your highnesses going out to receive her but in respect 
of her being a duenna it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that 
as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced they should 
let him pass freely as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil this i would 
give signed with my name if i knew how to sign and what i have said in this case is not out of 
my own head but one of the many precepts my master don quixote gave me the night before i 
left to become governor of this island that came into my mind and it was this that when there 
was any doubt about the justice of a case i should lean to mercy and it is gods will that i 
should recollect it now for it fits this case as if it was made for it that is true said the 
majordomo let your worship consider what is to be done with these men what is to be done 
said sancho is this you the winner be you good bad or indifferent give this assailant of 
yours a hundred reals at once and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners 
and you who have neither profession nor property and hang about the island in idleness 
take these hundred reals now and some time of the day tomorrow quit the island under sentence 
of banishment for ten years and under pain of completing it in another life if you violate 
the sentence for ill hang you on a gibbet or at least the hangman will by my orders not a word 
from either of you or ill make him feel my hand the one paid down the money and the other took 
it and the latter quitted the island while the other went home and then the governor said 
either i am not good for much or ill get rid of these gambling houses for it strikes me they 
are very mischievous this one at least said one of the notaries your worship will not be 
able to get rid of for a great man owns it and what he loses every year is beyond all comparison 
more than what he makes by the cards on the minor gambling houses your worship may exercise 
your power and it is they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices for 
in the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpers dare not attempt 
to play their tricks and as the vice of gambling has become common it is better that men 
should play in houses of repute than in some tradesmans where they catch an unlucky fellow 
in the small hours of the morning and skin him alive i know already notary that there is 
a good deal to be said on this matter of counties to which don quixote returned i have no 
doubt whatever that your worship is that don alvaro tarfe who appears in print in the second 
part nor this sancho panza my squire the one your worship knew that i will do most willingly 
replied don alvaro though it amazes me to find two don quixotes and two sancho panzas at 
once as much alike in name as they differ in demeanour and again i say and declare that what 
i saw i cannot have seen and that what happened me cannot have happened no doubt your worship 
is enchanted like my lady dulcinea del toboso said sancho and would to heaven your disenchantment 
rested on my giving myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what im giving myself 
for her for id lay them on without looking for anything i dont understand that about the 
lashes said don alvaro sancho replied that it was a long story to tell but he would tell 
him if they happened to be going the same road by this dinnertime arrived and don quixote 
and don alvaro dined together the alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together 
with a notary and don quixote laid a petition before him showing that it was requisite 
for his rights that don alvaro tarfe the gentleman there present should make a declaration 
before him that he did not know don quixote of la mancha also there present and that he was 
not the one that was in print in a history entitled second part of don quixote of la mancha 
hoc scripserunt monicongo academician of argamasilla on the tomb of dulcinea del toboso 
epitaph here dulcinea lies plump was she and robust now she is ashes and dust the end of 
all flesh that dies a lady of high degree with the port of a lofty dame and the great don quixotes 
flame and the pride of her village was she these were all the verses that could be deciphered 
the rest the writing being wormeaten were handed over to one of the academicians to make 
out their meaning conjecturally we have been informed that at the cost of many sleepless 
nights and much toil he has succeeded and that he means to publish them in hopes of don quixotes 
third sally forse altro cantera con miglior plectro end of part i don quixote volume ii 
complete by miguel de cervantes translated by john ormsby contents part ii chapter i 
of the interview the curate and the barber had with don quixote about his malady cide hamete 
benengeli in the second part of this history and third sally of don quixote says that the 
curate and the barber who had been listening to all attentively and in silence on his part 
some kindly words also and with no less goodwill than the curate offered his services 
in any way that might be of use to them he also explained to them in a few words the object 
that had brought them there and the strange nature of don quixotes madness and how they 
were waiting for his squire who had gone in search of him like the recollection of a dream 
the quarrel he had had with don quixote came back to cardenios memory and he described 
it to the others but he was unable to say what the dispute was about at this moment they heard 
a shout and recognised it as coming from sancho panza who not finding them where he had 
left them was calling aloud to them they went to meet him and in answer to their inquiries 
about don quixote he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt lank yellow half 
dead with hunger and sighing for his lady dulcinea and although he had told him that she 
commanded him to quit that place and come to el toboso where she was expecting him he had 
answered that he was determined not to confess unless quiteria first gave him her hand 
in marriage for that happiness would compose his mind and give him courage to make his 
confession don quixote hearing the wounded mans entreaty exclaimed aloud that what 
basilio asked was just and reasonable and moreover a request that might be easily complied 
with and that it would be as much to senor camachos honour to receive the lady quiteria 
as the widow of the brave basilio as if he received her direct from her father in this case 
said he it will be only to say yes and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word 
for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave camacho was listening to all this 
perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do but so urgent were the entreaties 
of basilios friends imploring him to allow quiteria to give him her hand so that his soul 
quitting this life in despair should not be lost that they moved nay forced him to say that 
if quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied as it was only putting off the fulfillment 
of his wishes for a moment at once all assailed quiteria and pressed her some with prayers 
and others with tears and others with persuasive arguments to give her hand to poor basilio 
but she harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue seemed unable or unwilling 
to utter a word nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly 
what she meant to do as basilio now had his soul at his teeth and there was no time for hesitation 
on this the fair quiteria to all appearance distressed grieved and repentant advanced 
without a word to where basilio lay his eyes already turned in his head his breathing short 
and painful murmuring the name of quiteria between his teeth and apparently about to 
die like a heathen and not like a christian quiteria approached him and kneeling demanded 
his hand by signs without speaking basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her said 
o quiteria why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve 
as a dagger to rob me of life for i have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness 
thou givest me in accepting me as thine or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing 
the dread shadow of death over my eyes what i entreat of thee o thou fatal star to me is that 
the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me be not given out of complaisance or to 
deceive me afresh but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon 
thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband for it is not meet that thou shouldst 
trifle with me at such a moment as this or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt 
so truly by thee while uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders 
expected each return of faintness would take his life with it then quiteria overcome 
with modesty and shame holding in her right hand the hand of basilio said no force would 
bend my will as freely therefore as it is possible for me to do so i give thee the hand of a 
lawful wife and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will untroubled and 
unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee yes i give it said basilio 
not agitated or distracted but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant 
me thus do i give myself to be thy wife said quiteria whether thou livest many years or they 
carry thee from my arms to the grave for one so badly wounded observed sancho at this point 
this young man has a great deal to say they should make him leave off billing and cooing 
and attend to his soul for to my thinking he has it more on his tongue than at his teeth basilio 
and quiteria having thus joined hands the priest deeply moved and with tears in his eyes 
pronounced the blessing upon them and implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the 
soul of the newly wedded man who the instant he received the blessing started nimbly to 
his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been sheathed 
in his body all the bystanders were astounded and some more simple than inquiring began 
shouting a miracle a miracle but basilio replied no miracle no miracle only a trick a trick 
the priest perplexed and amazed made haste to examine the wound with both hands and found 
that the blade had passed not through basilios flesh and ribs but through a hollow iron 
tube full of blood which he had adroitly fixed at the place the blood as was afterwards 
ascertained having been so prepared as not to congeal in short the priest and camacho 
and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of the bride showed no signs 
of displeasure at the deception on the contrary hearing them say that the marriage being 
fraudulent would not be valid she said that she confirmed it afresh whence they all concluded 
that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding between the pair whereat 
camacho and his supporters were so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves 
by violence and a great number of them drawing their swords attacked basilio in whose 
protection as many more swords were in an instant unsheathed while don quixote taking 
the lead on horseback with his lance over his arm and well covered with his shield made 
all give way before him sancho who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in such doings 
retreated to the winejars from which he had taken his delectable skimmings considering 
that as a holy place that spot would be respected hold sirs hold cried don quixote in a loud 
voice we have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us remember love 
and war are the same thing and as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and 
stratagems to overcome the enemy so in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and 
devices employed to attain the desired end are justifiable provided they be not to the 
discredit or dishonour of the loved object quiteria belonged to basilio and basilio 
to quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven camacho is rich and can purchase 
his pleasure when where and as it pleases him basilio has but this ewelamb and no one however 
powerful he may be shall take her from him these two whom god hath joined man cannot separate 
and he who attempts it must first pass the point of this lance and so saying he brandished 
it so stoutly and dexterously that he overawed all who did not know him but so deep an impression 
had the rejection of quiteria made on camachos mind that it banished her at once from his 
thoughts and so the counsels of the priest who was a wise and kindly disposed man prevailed 
with him and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised and to 
prove it put up their swords again inveighing against the pliancy of quiteria rather 
than the craftiness of basilio camacho maintaining that if quiteria as a maiden had such 
a love for basilio she would have loved him too as a married woman and that he ought to thank 
heaven more for having taken her than for having given her camacho and those of his following 
therefore being consoled and pacified those on basilios side were appeased and the rich 
camacho to show that he felt no resentment for the trick and did not care about it desired 
the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality neither basilio however nor 
his bride nor their followers would take any part in it and they withdrew to basilios village 
for the poor if they are persons of virtue and good sense have those who follow honour and 
uphold them just as the rich have those who flatter and dance attendance on them with them 
they carried don quixote regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one sancho alone had 
a cloud on his soul for he found himself debarred from waiting for camachos splendid feast 
and festival which lasted until night and thus dragged away he moodily followed his master 
who accompanied basilios party and left behind him the fleshpots of egypt though in his 
heart he took them with him and their now nearly finished skimmings that he carried in 
the bucket conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and abundance of the good cheer 
he was losing and so vexed and dejected though not hungry without dismounting from dapple 
he followed in the footsteps of rocinante chapter xxii wherin is related the grand adventure 
of the cave of montesinos in the heart of la mancha which the valiant don quixote brought 
to a happy termination chapter xxiii of the wonderful things the incomparable don quixote 
said he saw in the profound cave of montesinos the impossibility and magnitude of which 
cause this adventure to be deemed apocryphal it was about four in the afternoon when the 
sun veiled in clouds with subdued light and tempered beams enabled don quixote to relate 
without heat or inconvenience what he had seen in the cave of montesinos for though master 
pedros ape had told him that of those things part was true part false he clung more to their 
truth than to their falsehood the very reverse of sancho who held them all to be downright 
lies as they were thus proceeding then they discovered a small boat without oars or any 
other gear that lay at the waters edge tied to the stem of a tree growing on the bank don quixote 
looked all round and seeing nobody at once without more ado dismounted from rocinante 
and bade sancho get down from dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk of a poplar 
or willow that stood there sancho asked him the reason of this sudden dismounting and 
tying don quixote made answer thou must know sancho that this which comes opposite to 
us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor alifanfaron lord of the great isle of trapobana 
this other that marches behind me is that of his enemy the king of the garamantas pentapolin 
of the bare arm for he always goes into battle with his right arm bare but why are these two 
lords such enemies they are at enmity replied don quixote because this alifanfaron is 
a furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of pentapolin who is a very beautiful and 
moreover gracious lady and a christian and her father is unwilling to bestow her upon 
the pagan king unless he first abandons the religion of his false prophet mahomet and 
adopts his own by my beard said sancho but pentapolin does quite right and i will help him 
as much as i can in that thou wilt do what is thy duty sancho said don quixote for to engage 
in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed knight that i can well understand 
answered sancho but where shall we put this ass where we may be sure to find him after the 
fray is over for i believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of 
this kind that is true said don quixote but my squire values them at the rate he says as having 
been given me by the person who gave them roque guinart ordered them to be restored at once 
and making his men fall in in line he directed all the clothing jewellery and money that 
they had taken since the last distribution to be produced and making a hasty valuation 
and reducing what could not be divided into money he made shares for the whole band so equitably 
and carefully that in no case did he exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice 
when this had been done and all left satisfied roque observed to don quixote if this scrupulous 
exactness were not observed with these fellows there would be no living with them upon 
this sancho remarked from what i have seen here justice is such a good thing that there 
is no doing without it even among the thieves themselves one of the squires heard this 
and raising the buttend of his harquebuss would no doubt have broken sanchos head with 
it had not roque guinart called out to him to hold his hand sancho was frightened out of 
his wits and vowed not to open his lips so long as he was in the company of these people at 
this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch 
who came along them and report what passed to their chief came up and said senor there is 
a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona to which roque replied 
hast thou made out whether they are of the sort that are after us or of the sort we are after 
the sort we are after said the squire well then away with you all said roque and bring them 
here to me at once without letting one of them escape they obeyed and don quixote sancho 
and roque left by themselves waited to see what the squires brought and while they were 
waiting roque said to don quixote it must seem a strange sort of life to senor don quixote 
this of ours strange adventures strange incidents and all full of danger and i do not wonder 
that it should seem so for in truth i must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious 
than ours what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strong enough 
to disturb the quietest hearts i am by nature tenderhearted and kindly but as i said the 
desire to revenge myself for a wrong that was done me so overturns all my better impulses 
that i keep on in this way of life in spite of what conscience tells me and as one depth calls 
to another and one sin to another sin revenges have linked themselves together and i have 
taken upon myself not only my own but those of others it pleases god however that though 
i see myself in this maze of entanglements i do not lose all hope of escaping from it and 
reaching a safe port don quixote was amazed to hear roque utter such excellent and just 
sentiments for he did not think that among those who followed such trades as robbing murdering 
and waylaying there could be anyone capable of a virtuous thought and he said in reply 
senor roque the beginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick mans willingness 
to take the medicines which the physician prescribes you are sick you know what ails you 
and heaven or more properly speaking god who is our physician will administer medicines 
that will cure you and cure gradually and not of a sudden or by a miracle besides sinners 
of discernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools and as your worship has shown 
good sense in your remarks all you have to do is to keep up a good heart and trust that the 
weakness of your conscience will be strengthened and if you have any desire to shorten 
the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will show 
you how to become a knighterrant a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered 
that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice roque laughed 
at don quixotes exhortation and changing the conversation he related the tragic affair 
of claudia jeronima at which sancho was extremely grieved for he had not found the young 
womans beauty boldness and spirit at all amiss and now the squires despatched to make 
the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and 
a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback who were to bring him 
to the castle by fair means or foul if they met him they did meet him and sent word to the duke 
who having already settled what was to be done as soon as he heard of his arrival ordered 
the torches and lamps in the court to be lit and altisidora to be placed on the catafalque 
with all the pomp and ceremony that has been described the whole affair being so well arranged 
and acted that it differed but little from reality and cide hamete says moreover that 
for his part he considers the concocters of the joke as crazy as the victims of it and that 
the duke and duchess were not two fingers breadth removed from being something like fools 
themselves when they took such pains to make game of a pair of fools as for the latter one 
was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake occupied with his desultory thoughts 
when daylight came to them bringing with it the desire to rise for the lazy down was never 
a delight to don quixote victor or vanquished altisidora come back from death to life 
as don quixote fancied following up the freak of her lord and lady entered the chamber 
crowned with the garland she had worn on the catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered 
with gold flowers her hair flowing loose over her shoulders and leaning upon a staff of 
fine black ebony don quixote disconcerted and in confusion at her appearance huddled 
himself up and wellnigh covered himself altogether with the sheets and counterpane 
of the bed tonguetied and unable to offer her any civility altisidora seated herself 
on a chair at the head of the bed and after a deep sigh said to him in a feeble soft voice when 
women of rank and modest maidens trample honour under foot and give a loose to the tongue 
that breaks through every impediment publishing abroad the inmost secrets of their 
hearts they are reduced to sore extremities such a one am i senor don quixote of la mancha 
look upon the time i have spent in travelling with your worship as very well employed for 
i have gained four things in the course of it the first is that i have made your acquaintance 
which i consider great good fortune the second that i have learned what the cave of montesinos 
contains together with the transformations of guadiana and of the lakes of ruidera which 
will be of use to me for the spanish ovid that i have in hand the third to have discovered 
the antiquity of cards that they were in use at least in the time of charlemagne as may be 
inferred from the words you say durandarte uttered when at the end of that long spell while 
montesinos was talking to him he woke up and said patience and shuffle this phrase and 
expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted but only before he had become 
so in france and in the time of the aforesaid emperor charlemagne and this demonstration 
is just the thing for me for that other book i am writing the supplement to polydore vergil 
on the invention of antiquities for i believe he never thought of inserting that of cards 
in his book as i mean to do in mine and it will be a matter of great importance particularly 
when i can cite so grave and veracious an authority as senor durandarte and the fourth 
thing is that i have ascertained the source of the river guadiana heretofore unknown 
to mankind you are right said don quixote but i should like to know in case the time of favours 
should not come and it might be necessary to fall back upon wages how much did the squire 
of a knighterrant get in those days and did they agree by the month or by the day like bricklayers 
i do not believe replied don quixote that such squires were ever on wages but were dependent 
on favour and if i have now mentioned thine in the sealed will i have left at home it was with 
a view to what may happen for as yet i know not how chivalry will turn out in these wretched 
times of ours and i do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles in the other world for i would 
have thee know sancho that the valour which is not based upon a foundation of prudence 
is called rashness and the exploits of the rash man are to be attributed rather to good 
fortune than to courage and so i own that i retired but not that i fled and therein i have 
followed the example of many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times 
the histories are full of instances of this but as it would not be any good to thee or pleasure 
to me i will not recount them to thee now sancho was by this time mounted with the help of 
don quixote who then himself mounted rocinante and at a leisurely pace they proceeded 
to take shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off every now and 
then sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans and on don quixote asking him what 
caused such acute suffering he replied that from the end of his backbone up to the nape 
of his neck he was so sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses the cause of that soreness 
said don quixote will be no doubt that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very 
long one it caught thee all down the back where all the parts that are sore are situated 
and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still by god said sancho your worship 
has relieved me of a great doubt and cleared up the point for me in elegant style body o me 
is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that theres any need to tell me i am sore everywhere 
the staff hit me if it was my ankles that pained me there might be something in going divining 
why they did but it is not much to divine that im sore where they thrashed me by my faith master 
mine the ills of others hang by a hair every day i am discovering more and more how little 
i have to hope for from keeping company with your worship for if this time you have allowed 
me to be drubbed the next time or a hundred times more well have the blanketings of the other 
day over again and all the other pranks which if they have fallen on my shoulders now will 
be thrown in my teeth byandby i would do a great deal better i say to go home to my wife and 
children and support them and bring them up on what god may please to give me instead of 
following your worship along roads that lead nowhere and paths that are none at all with 
little to drink and less to eat and then when it comes to sleeping measure out seven feet 
on the earth brother squire and if thats not enough for you take as many more for you may 
have it all your own way and stretch yourself to your hearts content oh that i could see 
burnt and turned to ashes the first man that meddled with knighterrantry or at any rate 
the first who chose to be squire to such fools as all the knightserrant of past times must 
have been of those of the present day do not come up to the asceticism and austerity of former 
times but it does not follow from this that they are not all worthy at least i think them 
so and at the worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than the open sinner 
at this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on foot proceeding at 
a rapid pace and beating a mule loaded with lances and halberds when he came up to them he 
saluted them and passed on without stopping don quixote called to him stay good fellow 
you seem to be making more haste than suits that mule i cannot stop senor answered the man 
for the arms you see i carry here are to be used tomorrow so i must not delay god be with you 
but if you want to know what i am carrying them for i mean to lodge tonight at the inn that 
is beyond the hermitage and if you be going the same road you will find me there and i will 
tell you some curious things once more god be with you and he urged on his mule at such a pace 
that don quixote had no time to ask him what these curious things were that he meant to tell 
them and as he was somewhat inquisitive and always tortured by his anxiety to learn something 
new he decided to set out at once and go and pass the night at the inn instead of stopping 
at the hermitage where the cousin would have had them halt accordingly they mounted and 
all three took the direct road for the inn which they reached a little before nightfall 
on the road the cousin proposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup the instant 
sancho heard this he steered his dapple towards it and don quixote and the cousin did the 
same but it seems sanchos bad luck so ordered it that the hermit was not at home for so a subhermit 
they found in the hermitage told them they called for some of the best she replied that 
her master had none but that if they liked cheap water she would give it with great pleasure 
if i found any in water said sancho there are wells along the road where i could have had 
enough of it ah camachos wedding and plentiful house of don diego how often do i miss you 
leaving the hermitage they pushed on towards the inn and a little farther they came upon 
a youth who was pacing along in front of them at no great speed so that they overtook him 
he carried a sword over his shoulder and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently 
probably his breeches or pantaloons and his cloak and a shirt or two for he had on a short 
jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in places and had his shirt out his stockings 
were of silk and his shoes squaretoed as they wear them at court his age might have been 
eighteen or nineteen he was of a merry countenance and to all appearance of an active habit 
and he went along singing seguidillas to beguile the wearisomeness of the road as they 
came up with him he was just finishing one which the cousin got by heart and they say ran 
thus im off to the wars for the want of pence oh had i but money id show more sense the first 
to address him was don quixote who said you travel very airily sir gallant whither bound 
may we ask if it is your pleasure to tell us to which the youth replied the heat and my poverty 
are the reason of my travelling so airily and it is to the wars that i am bound how poverty 
asked don quixote the heat one can understand senor replied the youth in this bundle i 
carry velvet pantaloons to match this jacket if i wear them out on the road i shall not be 
able to keep from tears and my head aches so with all i shed last night for dapple that i am 
not fit to begin any fresh weeping but if it is your worships pleasure that i should see 
some insanities do them in your clothes short ones and such as come readiest to hand for 
i myself want nothing of the sort and as i have said it will be a saving of time for my return 
which will be with the news your worship desires and deserves if not let the lady dulcinea 
look to it if she does not answer reasonably i swear as solemnly as i can that i will fetch 
a fair answer out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs for why should it be borne that a knighterrant 
as famous as your worship should go mad without rhyme or reason for a her ladyship had best 
not drive me to say it for by god i will speak out and let off everything cheap even if it doesnt 
sell i am pretty good at that she little knows me faith if she knew me shed be in awe of me in 
faith sancho said don quixote to all appearance thou art no sounder in thy wits than i i 
am not so mad answered sancho but i am more peppery but apart from all this what has your 
worship to eat until i come back will you sally out on the road like cardenio to force it 
from the shepherds let not that anxiety trouble thee replied don quixote for even if i 
had it i should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which this meadow and these 
trees may yield me the beauty of this business of mine lies in not eating and in performing 
other mortifications do you know what i am afraid of said sancho upon this that i shall 
not be able to find my way back to this spot where i am leaving you it is such an outoftheway 
place observe the landmarks well said don quixote for i will now make the precious balsam 
with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an eye by this time the cuadrillero 
had succeeded in lighting the lamp and came in to see the man that he thought had been killed 
and as sancho caught sight of him at the door seeing him coming in his shirt with a cloth 
on his head and a lamp in his hand and a very forbidding countenance he said to his master 
senor can it be that this is the enchanted moor coming back to give us more castigation 
if there be anything still left in the inkbottle it cannot be the moor answered don quixote 
for those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone if they dont let themselves 
be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho if not let my shoulders speak to the point 
mine could speak too said don quixote but that is not a sufficient reason for believing 
that what we see is the enchanted moor the officer came up and finding them engaged in such 
a peaceful conversation stood amazed though don quixote to be sure still lay on his back 
unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters the officer turned to him and said well 
how goes it good man i would speak more politely if i were you replied don quixote is it the 
way of this country to address knightserrant in that style you booby the cuadrillero 
finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a sorrylooking individual lost 
his temper and raising the lamp full of oil smote don quixote such a blow with it on the head 
that he gave him a badly broken pate then all being in darkness he went out and sancho panza 
said that is certainly the enchanted moor senor and he keeps the treasure for others and 
for us only the cuffs and lampwhacks that is the truth answered don quixote and there is 
no use in troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or vexed 
at them for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no one on whom to avenge ourselves 
do what we may rise sancho if thou canst and call the alcaide of this fortress and get him 
to give me a little oil wine salt and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam for indeed 
i believe i have great need of it now because i am losing much blood from the wound that phantom 
gave me sancho got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the innkeeper in the dark 
and meeting the officer who was looking to see what had become of his enemy he said to him 
senor whoever you are do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary oil salt 
and wine for it is wanted to cure one of the best knightserrant on earth who lies on yonder 
bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted moor that is in this inn when the officer heard 
him talk in this way he took him for a man out of his senses and as day was now beginning to 
break he opened the inn gate and calling the host he told him what this good man wanted the 
host furnished him with what he required and sancho brought it to don quixote who with 
his hand to his head was bewailing the pain of the blow of the lamp which had done him no more 
harm than raising a couple of rather large lumps and what he fancied blood was only the 
sweat that flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received 
in battle and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm and quiet saying 
that this water was a most precious potion which the sage esquife a great magician and 
friend of his had brought him but i take all the blame upon myself for i had no business to 
put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like myself and so i believe 
that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the god of battles has 
permitted this chastisement to be administered to me for which reason brother sancho 
it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which i am now about to mention to thee 
for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us it is at when thou shalt see rabble 
of this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till i draw sword against them for i 
shall not do so at all but do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy hearts content and 
if any knights come to their aid and defence i will take care to defend thee and assail them 
with all my might and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might 
of this strong arm of mine is equal toso uplifted had the poor gentleman become through 
the victory over the stout biscayan but sancho did not so fully approve of his masters 
admonition as to let it pass without saying in reply senor i am a man of peace meek and quiet 
and i can put up with any affront because i have a wife and children to set about obtaining 
dispensations to enable me to hold a place of profit under the church would be endless 
work so that senor it all turns on my master marrying this lady at oncefor as yet i do not 
know her grace and so i cannot call her by her name she is called the princess micomicona 
lawful heiress of the great kingdom of micomicon who has come in search of your master 
to beg a boon of him which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done 
her and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired far and wide this princess 
has come from guinea to seek him a lucky seeking and a lucky finding said sancho panza at 
this especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury and right that 
wrong and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship speaks of as kill him he will if 
he meets him unless indeed he happens to be a phantom for my master has no power at all against 
phantoms but one thing among others i would beg of you senor licentiate which is that to 
prevent my master taking a fancy to be an archbishop for that is what im afraid of your worship 
would recommend him to marry this princess at once for in this way he will be disabled from 
taking archbishops orders and will easily come into his empire and i to the end of my desires 
i have been thinking over the matter carefully and by what i can make out i find it will not 
do for me that my master should become an archbishop because i am no good for the church 
as i am married and for me now having as i have a wife and children to support and bring up 
so let it be likewise a hint to your worship as it cannot be a mandate that on no account will 
i draw sword either against clown or against knight and that here before god i forgive 
the insults that have been offered me whether they have been are or shall be offered me 
by high or low rich or poor noble or commoner not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever 
to all which his master said in reply i wish i had breath enough to speak somewhat easily 
and that the pain i feel on this side would abate so as to let me explain to thee panza the 
mistake thou makest come now sinner suppose the wind of fortune hitherto so adverse should 
turn in our favour filling the sails of our desires so that safely and without impediment 
we put into port in some one of those islands i have promised thee how would it be with thee 
if on winning it i made thee lord of it why thou wilt make it wellnigh impossible through 
not being a knight nor having any desire to be one nor possessing the courage nor the will 
to avenge insults or defend thy lordship for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms 
and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the 
new lord that there is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more and 
try as they say what chance may do for them so it is essential that the new possessor should 
have good sense to enable him to govern and valour to attack and defend himself whatever 
may befall him in what has now befallen us answered sancho id have been well pleased to 
have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of but i swear on the faith of a 
poor man i am more fit for plasters than for arguments see if your worship can get up and 
let us help rocinante though he does not deserve it for he was the main cause of all this 
thrashing i never thought it of rocinante for i took him to be a virtuous person and as quiet 
as myself after all they say right that it takes a long time to come to know people and that 
there is nothing sure in this life who would have said that after such mighty slashes as 
your worship gave that unlucky knighterrant there was coming travelling post and at 
the very heels of them such a great storm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders and 
yet thine sancho replied don quixote ought to be used to such squalls but mine reared in 
soft cloth and fine linen it is plain they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap 
and if it were not that i imaginewhy do i say imagineknow of a certainty that all these annoyances 
are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms i would lay me down here to die 
of pure vexation to this the squire replied senor as these mishaps are what one reaps of 
chivalry tell me if they happen very often or if they have their own fixed times for coming 
to pass because it seems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is useless 
and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out some day for who knows but that your 
enemy the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies that i am going to 
destroy him and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himself in some 
impregnable castle or stronghold against which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable 
arm may avail but little therefore lady let us as i say forestall his schemes by our activity 
and let us depart at once in quest of fair fortune for your highness is only kept from enjoying 
it as fully as you could desire by my delay in encountering your adversary don quixote 
held his peace and said no more calmly awaiting the reply of the beauteous princess who 
with commanding dignity and in a style adapted to don quixotes own replied to him in these 
words i give you thanks sir knight for the eagerness you like a good knight to whom it is 
a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy display to afford me aid in my 
sore trouble and heaven grant that your wishes and mine may be realised so that you may 
see that there are women in this world capable of gratitude as to my departure let it be 
forthwith for i have no will but yours dispose of me entirely in accordance with your good 
pleasure for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her person and placed in your 
hands the recovery of her dominions must not think of offering opposition to that which 
your wisdom may ordain on then in gods name said don quixote for when a lady humbles herself 
to me i will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and placing her on the throne of her 
ancestors let us depart at once for the common saying that in delay there is danger lends 
spurs to my eagerness to take the road and as neither heaven has created nor hell seen any 
that can daunt or intimidate me saddle rocinante sancho and get ready thy ass and the queens 
palfrey and let us take leave of the castellan and these gentlemen and go hence this very 
instant sancho who was standing by all the time said shaking his head ah master master 
there is more mischief in the village than one hears of begging all good bodies pardon 
what mischief can there be in any village or in all the cities of the world you booby that 
can hurt my reputation said don quixote if your worship is angry replied sancho i will 
hold my tongue and leave unsaid what as a good squire i am bound to say and what a good servant 
should tell his master say what thou wilt returned don quixote provided thy words be not 
meant to work upon my fears for thou if thou fearest art behaving like thyself but i like 
myself in not fearing it is nothing of the sort as i am a sinner before god said sancho but 
that i take it to be sure and certain that this lady who calls herself queen of the great 
kingdom of micomicon who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him which is that 
he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done her and from the fame as a good knight 
which your master has acquired far and wide this princess has come from guinea to seek 
him a lucky seeking and a lucky finding said sancho panza at this especially if my master 
has the good fortune to redress that injury and right that wrong and kill that son of a bitch 
of a giant your worship speaks of as kill him he will if he meets him unless indeed he happens 
to be a phantom for my master has no power at all against phantoms but one thing among others 
i would beg of you senor licentiate which is that to prevent my master taking a fancy to 
be an archbishop and not an emperor as is usual and customary with knightserrant be not 
uneasy friend sancho said the barber for we will entreat your master and advise him even 
urging it upon him as a case of conscience to become an emperor and not an archbishop because 
it will be easier for him as he is more valiant than lettered so i have thought said sancho 
though i can tell you he is fit for anything what i mean to do for my part is to pray to our lord 
to place him where it may be best for him and where he may be able to bestow most favours upon 
me you speak like a man of sense said the curate and you will be acting like a good christian 
but what must now be done is to take steps to coax your master out of that useless penance 
you say he is performing and we had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt 
and also to dine for it is now time sancho said they might go in but that he would wait there 
outside and that he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling and why 
it did not suit him to enter it but he begged them to bring him out something to eat and to 
let it be hot and also to bring barley for rocinante they left him and went in and presently 
the barber brought him out something to eat byandby after they had between them carefully 
thought over what they should do to carry out their object the curate hit upon an idea very 
well adapted to humour don quixote and effect their purpose and his notion which he explained 
to the barber was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel while 
the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire and that they should thus proceed 
to where don quixote was and he pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel should 
ask a favour of him which as a valiant knighterrant he could not refuse to grant and the 
favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she would conduct him 
in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her while at the same time she 
should entreat him not to require her to remove her mask nor ask her any question touching 
her circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight and he had no doubt that 
don quixote would comply with any request made in these terms and that in this way they 
might remove him and take him to his own village where they would endeavour to find out 
if his extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of remedy chapter xxvii of how the curate 
and the barber proceeded with their scheme together with other matters worthy of record 
in this great history the curates plan did not seem a bad one to the barber but on the contrary 
so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution they begged a petticoat 
and hood of the landlady leaving her in pledge a new cassock of the curates and the barber 
made a beard out of a greybrown or red oxtail in which the landlord used to stick his comb 
the landlady asked them what they wanted these things for and the curate told her in a few 
words about the madness of don quixote and how this disguise was intended to get him away 
from the mountain where he then was the landlord and landlady immediately came to the 
conclusion that the madman was their guest the balsam man and master of the blanketed 
squire and they told the curate all that had passed between him and her handmaid and the 
promise she had given him to inform him matters of serious importance there is no need 
of saying whether camilla was agitated or not for so great was her fear and dismay that 
making sure as she had good reason to do that leonela would tell anselmo all she knew of 
her faithlessness she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed 
and that same night as soon as she thought that anselmo was asleep she packed up the most 
valuable jewels she had and some money and without being observed by anybody escaped 
from the house and betook herself to lotharios to whom she related what had occurred imploring 
him to convey her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be safe from anselmo 
the state of perplexity to which camilla reduced lothario was such that he was unable 
to utter a word in reply but at length he said i have listened lothario my friend attentively 
as thou hast seen to what thou hast chosen to say to me and in thy arguments examples and 
comparisons i have seen that high intelligence thou dost possess and the perfection 
of true friendship thou hast reached and likewise i see and confess that if i am not guided 
by thy opinion but follow my own i am flying from the good and pursuing the evil this being 
so thou must remember that i am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes 
suffer from when the craving seizes them to eat clay plaster charcoal and things even 
worse disgusting to look at much more to eat so that it will be necessary to have recourse 
to some artifice to cure me and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a beginning 
even though it be in a lukewarm and makebelieve fashion to pay court to camilla who will 
not be so yielding that her virtue will give way at the first attack with this mere attempt 
i shall rest satisfied and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to do not 
only in giving me life but in persuading me not to discard my honour and this thou art bound 
to do for one reason alone that being as i am resolved to apply this test it is not for thee 
to permit me to reveal my weakness to another and so imperil that honour thou art striving 
to keep me from losing and if thine may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of 
camilla while thou art paying court to her that is of little or no importance because ere 
long on finding in her that constancy which we expect thou canst tell her the plain truth 
as regards our stratagem and so regain thy place in her esteem and as thou art venturing 
so little and by the venture canst afford me so much satisfaction refuse not to undertake 
it even if further difficulties present themselves to thee for as i have said if thou wilt 
only make a beginning i will acknowledge the issue decided lothario seeing the fixed 
determination of anselmo and not knowing what further examples to offer or arguments 
to urge in order to dissuade him from it and perceiving that he threatened to confide his 
pernicious scheme to some one else to avoid a greater evil resolved to gratify him and 
do what he asked intending to manage the business so as to satisfy anselmo without corrupting 
the mind of camilla so in reply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other for 
he would undertake the task himself and would begin it as soon as he pleased anselmo embraced 
him warmly and affectionately and thanked him for his offer as if he had bestowed some 
great favour upon him and it was agreed between them to set about it the next day anselmo 
affording opportunity and time to lothario to converse alone with camilla and furnishing 
him with money and jewels to offer and present to her he suggested too that he should treat 
her to music and write verses in her praise and if he was unwilling to take the trouble of 
composing them he offered to do it himself lothario agreed to all with an intention very 
different from what anselmo supposed and with this understanding they returned to anselmos 
house where they found camilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily for he was 
later than usual in returning that day lothario repaired to his own house and anselmo 
remained in his as well satisfied as lothario was troubled in mind for he could see no satisfactory 
way out of this illadvised business that night however he thought of a plan by which he 
might deceive anselmo without any injury to camilla the next day he went to dine with his 
friend and was welcomed by camilla who received and treated him with great cordiality 
knowing the affection her husband felt for him when dinner was over and the cloth removed 
anselmo told lothario to stay there with camilla while he attended to some pressing business 
as he would return in an hour and a half camilla begged him not to go and lothario offered 
to accompany him but nothing could persuade anselmo who on the contrary pressed lothario 
to remain waiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with him sancho 
obeyed and when the two had gone some distance in advance don quixote said to him since 
thy return i have had no opportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy 
mission and the answer thou hast brought back and now that chance has granted us the time 
and opportunity deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good news let your 
worship ask what you will answered sancho for i shall find a way out of all these difficulties 
when we had decided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy for he would lose his 
life or restore us to liberty for four days the bano was filled with people for which reason 
the reed delayed its appearance for four days but at the end of that time he woke up and in 
a loud voice exclaimed blessed be almighty god who has shown me such goodness in truth 
his mercies are boundless and the sins of men can neither limit them nor keep them back 
the niece listened with attention to her uncles words and they struck her as more coherent 
than what usually fell from him at least during his illness so she asked what are you saying 
senor has anything strange occurred what mercies or what sins of men are you talking of 
the mercies niece said don quixote are those that god has this moment shown me and with 
him as i said my sins are no impediment to them my reason is now free and clear rid of the dark 
shadows of ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books of chivalry 
cast over it now i see through their absurdities and deceptions and it only grieves me 
that this destruction of my illusions has come so late that it leaves me no time to make 
some amends by reading other books that might be a light to my soul niece i feel myself at 
the point of death and i would fain meet it in such a way as to save their stratagem from being 
discovered the canon replying to don quixote said in truth brother i know more about books 
of chivalry than i do about villalpandos elements of logic so if that be all you may safely 
tell me what you please in gods name then senor replied don quixote if that be so i would 
have you know that this don quixote you speak of is the greatest friend i have in the world 
so much so that i may say i regard him in the same light as my own person and from the precise 
and clear indications you have given i cannot but think that he must be the very one you 
have vanquished on the other hand i see that amadis of gaul without losing his senses and 
without doing anything mad acquired as a lover as much fame as the most famous for according 
to his history on finding himself rejected by his lady oriana who had ordered him not to 
appear in her presence until it should be her pleasure all he did was to retire to the pena 
pobre in company with a hermit and there he took his fill of weeping until heaven sent him 
relief in the midst of his great grief and need and if this be true as it is why should i now 
take the trouble to strip stark naked or do mischief to these trees which have done me no 
harm or why am i to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which will give me to drink whenever 
i have a mind long live the memory of amadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible 
by don quixote of la mancha of whom the commandant and all the citizens had already heard 
that afternoon to see them and what happened on board of them will be told in the next chapter 
chapter lxiii of the mishap that befell sancho panza through the visit to the galleys 
and the strange adventure of the fair morisco profound were don quixotes reflections 
on the reply of the enchanted head not one of them however hitting on the secret of the trick 
but all concentrated on the promise which he regarded as a certainty of dulcineas disenchantment 
this he turned over in his mind again and again with great satisfaction fully persuaded 
that he would shortly see its fulfillment and as for sancho though as has been said he hated 
being a governor still he had a longing to be giving orders and finding himself obeyed 
once more this is the misfortune that being in authority even in jest brings with it to 
resume that afternoon their host don antonio moreno and his two friends with don quixote 
and sancho went to the galleys the commandant had been already made aware of his good fortune 
in seeing two such famous persons as don quixote and sancho and the instant they came to 
the shore all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions rang out a skiff covered 
with rich carpets and cushions of crimson velvet was immediately lowered into the water 
and as don quixote stepped on board of it the leading galley fired her gangway gun and the 
other galleys did the same and as he mounted the starboard ladder the whole crew saluted 
him as is the custom when a personage of distinction comes on board a galley by exclaiming 
hu hu hu three times the general for so we shall call him a valencian gentleman of rank gave 
him his hand and embraced him saying i shall mark this day with a white stone as one of the 
happiest i can expect to enjoy in my lifetime since i have seen senor don quixote of la mancha 
what happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your worship is coming 
back to his castle for he is still there with my lady the duchess i do not recognise you friend 
said don quixote nor do i know who you are unless you tell me i am tosilos my lord the dukes 
lacquey upon us in place of the real husband the justice of god and the king against such 
trickery not to say roguery do not distress yourselves ladies said don quixote for this 
is no trickery or roguery or if it is it is not the duke who is at the bottom of it but those 
wicked enchanters who persecute me and who jealous of my reaping the glory of this victory 
have turned your husbands features into those of this person who you say is a lacquey of 
the dukes take my advice and notwithstanding the malice of my enemies marry him for beyond 
a doubt he is the one you wish for a husband when the duke heard this all his anger was near 
vanishing in a fit of laughter and he said the things that happen to senor don quixote are 
so extraordinary that i am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not one but let us adopt 
this plan and device let us put off the marriage for say a fortnight and let us keep this 
person about whom we are uncertain in close confinement and perhaps in the course of that 
time he may return to his original shape for the spite which the enchanters entertain 
against senor don quixote cannot last so long especially as it is of so little advantage 
to them to practise these deceptions and transformations oh senor said sancho those 
scoundrels are well used to changing whatever concerns my master from one thing into 
another a knight that he overcame some time back called the knight of the mirrors they 
turned into the shape of the bachelor samson carrasco of our town and a great friend of 
ours and my lady dulcinea del toboso they have turned into a common country wench so i suspect 
this lacquey will have to live and die a lacquey all the days of his life here the rodriguezs 
daughter exclaimed let him be who he may this man that claims me for a wife i am thankful 
to him for the same for i had rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress 
of a gentleman though he who played me false is nothing of the kind to be brief all the talk 
and all that had happened ended in tosilos being shut up until it was seen how his transformation 
turned out all hailed don quixote as victor but the greater number were vexed and disappointed 
at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously waiting for had not battered 
one another to pieces just as the boys are disappointed when the man they are waiting to 
see hanged does not come out because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him the 
people dispersed the duke and don quixote returned to the castle they locked up tosilos 
dona rodriguez and her daughter remained perfectly contented when they saw that any 
way the affair must end in marriage and tosilos wanted nothing else chapter lvii which 
treats of how don quixote took leave of the goatherd and once more mounting rocinante 
bade sancho follow him which he having no ass did very discontentedly they proceeded 
slowly making their way into the most rugged part of the mountain sancho all the while 
dying to have a talk with his master and longing for him to begin so that there should be 
no breach of the injunction laid upon him but unable to keep silence so long he said to him 
senor don quixote give me your worships blessing and dismissal for id like to go home at 
once to my wife and children with whom i can at any rate talk and converse as much as i like 
for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when i have 
a mind is burying me alive if luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days 
of guisopete it would not be so bad if we had something to eat for woes are lighter if theres 
bread but sometimes we go a day or two without breaking our fast except with the wind that 
blows all that said he of the grove i have made up my mind and determined to have done with 
these drunken vagaries of these knights and go back to my village and bring up my children 
for i have three like three oriental pearls i have two said sancho that might be presented 
before the pope himself especially a girl whom i am breeding up for a countess please god 
though in spite of her mother and how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess 
asked he of the grove fifteen a couple of years more or less answered sancho but she is as 
tall as a lance and as fresh as an april morning and as strong as a porter those are gifts 
to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of the greenwood said he of the grove whoreson 
strumpet what pith the rogue must have to which sancho made answer somewhat sulkily shes 
no strumpet nor was her mother nor will either of them be please god while i live speak more 
civilly for one bred up among knightserrant who are courtesy itself your words dont seem 
to me to be very becoming o how little you know about compliments sir squire returned he 
of the grove what dont you know that when a horseman delivers a good lance thrust at the 
bull in the plaza or when anyone does anything very well the people are wont to say ha whoreson 
rip how well he has done it and that what seems to be abuse in the expression is high praise 
disown sons and daughters senor who dont do what deserves that compliments of this sort 
should be paid to their parents i do disown them replied sancho and in this way and by the 
same reasoning you might call me and my children and my wife all the strumpets in the world 
for all they do and say is of a kind that in the highest degree deserves the same praise and 
to see them again i pray god to deliver me from mortal sin or what comes to the same thing 
to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which i have fallen a second time 
decayed and beguiled by a purse with a hundred ducats that i found one day in the heart of 
the sierra morena and the devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes 
here there everywhere until i fancy at every stop i am putting my hand on it and hugging 
it and carrying it home with me and making investments and getting interest and living 
like a prince and so long as i think of this i make light of all the hardships i endure with 
this simpleton of a master of mine who i well know is more of a madman than a knight theres 
why they say that covetousness bursts the bag said he of the grove but if you come to talk 
of that sort there is not a greater one in the world than my master for he is one of those of 
whom they say the cares of others kill the ass for in order that another knight may recover 
the senses he has lost he makes a madman of himself and goes looking for what when found 
may for all i know fly in his own face and is he in love perchance asked sancho he is said of 
the grove with one casildea de vandalia the rawest and best roasted lady the whole world 
could produce but that rawness is not the only foot he limps on for he has greater schemes 
rumbling in his bowels as will be seen before many hours are over theres no road so smooth 
but it has some hole or hindrance in it said sancho in other houses they cook beans but in 
mine its by the potful madness will have more followers and hangerson than sound sense 
but if there be any truth in the common saying that to have companions in trouble gives 
some relief i may take consolation from you inasmuch as you serve a master as crazy as my 
own crazy but valiant replied he of the grove and more roguish than crazy or valiant mine 
is not that said sancho i mean he has nothing of the rogue in him on the contrary he has the 
soul of a pitcher he has no thought of doing harm to anyone only good to all nor has he any 
malice whatever in him a child might persuade him that it is night at noonday and for this 
simplicity i love him as the core of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels be thou lady 
mine transformed into a clumsy country wench or into a nymph of golden tagus weaving a 
web of silk and gold let merlin or montesinos hold thee captive where they will whereer 
thou art thou art mine and whereer i am must be thine the very instant he had uttered these 
words the door opened he stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a yellow satin coverlet 
with a cap on his head and his face and his moustaches tied up his face because of the scratches 
and his moustaches to keep them from drooping and falling down in which trim he looked 
the most extraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived he kept his eyes fixed on the 
door and just as he was expecting to see the lovesmitten and unhappy altisidora make her 
appearance he saw coming in a most venerable duenna in a long whitebordered veil that 
covered and enveloped her from head to foot between the fingers of her left hand she held 
a short lighted candle while with her right she shaded it to keep the light from her eyes 
which were covered by spectacles of great size and she advanced with noiseless steps 
treading very softly don quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower and observing 
her costume and noting her silence he concluded that it must be some brawl of maritornes 
because after calling loudly to her he got no answer with this suspicion he got up and lighting 
a lamp hastened to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance the wench seeing that 
her master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible frightened and panicstricken 
made for the bed of sancho panza who still slept and crouching upon it made a ball of herself 
the innkeeper came in exclaiming where art thou strumpet of course this is some of thy 
work at this sancho awoke and feeling this mass almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare 
and began to distribute fisticuffs all round of which a certain share fell upon maritornes 
who irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside paid back so many in return to sancho 
that she woke him up in spite of himself he then told cardenio and dorothea what they had 
proposed to do to cure don quixote or at any rate take him home upon which dorothea said 
that she could play the distressed damsel better than the barber especially as she had 
there the dress in which to do it to the life and that they might trust to her acting the part 
in every particular requisite for carrying out their scheme for she had read a great many 
books of chivalry and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons 
of knightserrant in that case said the curate i will read it if it were only out of curiosity 
perhaps it may contain something pleasant master nicholas added his entreaties to the 
same effect and sancho too seeing which and considering that he would give pleasure to 
all and receive it himself the curate said well then attend to me everyone for the novel 
begins thus chapter xxxiii in which is related the novel of the illadvised curiosity 
had been good he concluded this would be so too as they were both probably by the same author 
so he kept it intending to read it when he had an opportunity he then mounted and his friend 
the barber did the same both masked so as not to be recognised by don quixote and set out 
following in the rear of the cart the order of march was this first went the cart with the 
owner leading it at each side of it marched the officers of the brotherhood as has been 
said with their muskets then followed sancho panza on his ass leading rocinante by the 
bridle and behind all came the curate and the barber on the means to be adopted to induce 
don quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet without worrying himself with his illstarred 
adventures at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all and on the 
special advice of carrasco that don quixote should be allowed to go as it seemed impossible 
to restrain him and that samson should sally forth to meet him as a knighterrant and do 
battle with him for there would be no difficulty about a cause and vanquish him that being 
looked upon as an easy matter and that it should be agreed and settled that the vanquished 
was to be at the mercy of the victor then don quixote being vanquished the bachelor knight 
was to command him to return to his village and his house and not quit it for two years or 
until he received further orders from him all which it was clear don quixote would unhesitatingly 
obey rather than contravene or fail to observe the laws of chivalry and during the period 
of his seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly or there might be an opportunity of 
discovering some ready remedy for his madness carrasco undertook the task and tom cecial 
a gossip and neighbour of sancho panzas a lively featherheaded fellow offered himself 
as his squire carrasco armed himself in the fashion described and tom cecial that he might 
not be known by his gossip when they met fitted on over his own natural nose the false masquerade 
one that has been mentioned and so they followed the same route don quixote took and almost 
came up with him in time to be present at the adventure of the cart of death and finally encountered 
them in the grove where all that the sagacious reader has been reading about took place 
and had it not been for the millers who plunged in and hoisted them both out it would have 
been troy town with the pair of them as soon as more drenched than thirsty they were landed 
sancho went down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven prayed a 
long and fervent prayer to god to deliver him evermore from the rash projects and attempts 
of his master the fishermen the owners of the boat which the millwheels had knocked to 
pieces now came up and seeing it smashed they proceeded to strip sancho and to demand payment 
for it from don quixote but he with great calmness just as if nothing had happened him told 
the millers and fishermen that he would pay for the bark most cheerfully on condition 
that they delivered up to him free and unhurt the person or persons that were in durance 
in that castle of theirs what persons or what castle art thou talking of madman art thou 
for carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills thats enough said don 
quixote to himself it would be preaching in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce 
this rabble to do any virtuous action in this adventure two mighty enchanters must have 
encountered one another and one frustrates what the other attempts one provided the 
bark for me and the other upset me god help us this world is all machinations and schemes 
at cross purposes one with the other i can do no more and then turning towards the mills 
he said aloud friends whoeer ye be that are immured in that prison forgive me that to my 
misfortune and yours i cannot deliver you from your misery this adventure is doubtless 
reserved and destined for some other knight so saying he settled with the fishermen and 
paid fifty reals for the boat which sancho handed to them very much against the grain saying 
with a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our whole capital the fishermen 
and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two figures so very different to all 
appearance from ordinary men and were wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations 
and questions don quixote addressed to them and coming to the conclusion that they were 
madmen they left them and betook themselves the millers to their mills and the fishermen 
to their huts don quixote and sancho returned to their beasts and to their life of beasts 
and so ended the adventure of the enchanted bark chapter xxx of don quixotes adventure 
with a fair huntress they reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough knight 
and squire sancho particularly for with him what touched the stock of money touched his 
heart and when any was taken from him he felt as if he was robbed of the apples of his eyes 
in fine without exchanging a word they mounted and quitted the famous river don quixote 
absorbed in thoughts of his love sancho in thinking of his advancement which just then 
it seemed to him he was very far from securing for fool as he was he saw clearly enough that 
his masters acts were all or most of them utterly senseless and he began to cast about for 
an opportunity of retiring from his service and going home some day without entering 
into any explanations or taking any farewell of him fortune however ordered matters 
after a fashion very much the opposite of what he contemplated it so happened that the 
next day towards sunset on coming out of a wood don quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow 
and at the far end of it observed some people and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawking 
party coming closer he distinguished among them a lady of graceful mien on a pure white 
palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings and a silvermounted sidesaddle 
the lady was also in green and so richly and splendidly dressed that splendour itself 
seemed personified in her on her left hand she bore a hawk a proof to don quixotes mind that 
she must be some great lady and the mistress of the whole hunting party which was the fact 
so he said to sancho run sancho my son and say to that lady on the palfrey with the hawk that 
i the knight of the lions kiss the hands of her exalted beauty and if her excellence will 
grant me leave i will go and kiss them in person and place myself at her service for aught 
that may be in my power and her highness may command and mind sancho how thou speakest and 
take care not to thrust in any of thy proverbs into thy message youve got a likely one here 
to thrust any in said sancho leave me alone for that why this is not the first time in my life 
i have carried messages to high and exalted ladies except that thou didst carry to the 
lady dulcinea said don quixote i know not that thou hast carried any other at least in my 
service that is true replied sancho but pledges dont distress a good payer and he whom 
god helps does better than he who gets up early and its the tripes that carry the feet and 
not the feet the tripes i mean to say that if god gives me help and i do my duty honestly no 
doubt ill govern better than a gerfalcon nay let them only put a finger in my mouth and theyll 
see whether i can bite or not the curse of god and all his saints upon thee thou accursed 
sancho exclaimed don quixote when will the day comeas i have often said to theewhen i shall 
hear thee make one single coherent rational remark without proverbs pray your highnesses 
leave this fool alone for he will grind your souls between not to say two but two thousand 
proverbs dragged in as much in season and as much to the purpose asmay god grant as much 
health to him or to me if i want to listen to them sancho panzas proverbs said the duchess 
though more in number than the greek commanders are not therefore less to be esteemed 
for the conciseness of the maxims for my own part i can only say that i did not uncover my 
eyes either above or below nor did i see sky or earth or sea or shore it is true i felt that 
i was passing through the region of the air and even that i touched that of fire but that 
we passed farther i cannot believe for the region of fire being between the heaven of the 
moon and the last region of the air we could not have reached that heaven where the seven 
goats sancho speaks of are without being burned and as we were not burned either sancho 
is lying or sancho is dreaming i am neither lying nor dreaming said sancho only ask me the 
tokens of those same goats and youll see by that whether im telling the truth or not tell 
us them then sancho said the duchess two of them said sancho are green two bloodred two 
blue and one a mixture of all colours an odd sort of goat that said the duke in this earthly 
region of ours we have no such colours i mean goats of such colours thats very plain said 
sancho of course there must be a difference between master and man between lord and lackey 
between knight and squire so that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe 
more respect and take less liberties for in whatever way i may be provoked with you it will 
be bad for the pitcher the favours and benefits that i have promised you will come in due 
time and if they do not your wages at least will not be lost as i have already told you all 
that your worship says is very well said sancho but i should like to know in case the time 
of favours should not come and it might be necessary to fall back upon wages how much did 
the squire of a knighterrant get in those days and did they agree by the month or by the day 
like bricklayers i do not believe replied don quixote that such squires were ever on wages 
but were dependent on favour and if i have now mentioned thine in the sealed will i have 
left at home it was with a view to what may happen for as yet i know not how chivalry will turn 
out in these wretched times of ours and i do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles in the 
other world for i will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world can do or at any rate 
i will give you such a revenge over those who shall have sent him there that you will be more 
than moderately satisfied and without saying anything more he went and knelt before 
dorothea requesting her highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant 
him permission to aid and succour the castellan of that castle who now stood in grievous 
jeopardy the princess granted it graciously and he at once bracing his buckler on his 
arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and down in front of the 
trough and as he began his march night began to fall the landlord told all the people who 
were in the inn about the craze of his guest the watching of the armour and the dubbing ceremony 
he contemplated full of wonder at so strange a form of madness they flocked to see it from 
a distance and observed with what composure he sometimes paced up and down or sometimes 
leaning on his lance gazed on his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long 
and as the night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with 
his that lent it everything the novice knight did was plainly seen by all meanwhile one 
of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water his team and it was necessary to 
remove don quixotes armour as it lay on the trough but he seeing the other approach hailed 
him in a loud voice o thou whoever thou art rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armour 
of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword have a care what thou dost remember 
what thou owest me bethink thee thou art mine and canst not be anothers reflect that thy 
utterance of yes and the end of my life will come at the same instant o treacherous don fernando 
robber of my glory death of my life what seekest thou remember that thou canst not as a christian 
attain the object of thy wishes for luscinda is my bride and i am her husband fool that i 
am now that i am far away and out of danger i say i should have done what i did not do now that 
i have allowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me i curse the robber on whom i might 
have taken vengeance had i as much heart for it as i have for bewailing my fate in short as 
i was then a coward and a fool little wonder is it if i am now dying shamestricken remorseful 
and mad the priest stood waiting for the answer of luscinda who for a long time withheld 
it and just as i thought she was taking out the dagger to save her honour or struggling for 
words to make some declaration of the truth on my behalf i heard her say in a faint and feeble 
voice i will don fernando said the same and giving her the ring they stood linked by a knot 
that could never be loosed the bridegroom then approached to embrace his bride and she 
pressing her hand upon her heart fell fainting in her mothers arms it only remains now 
for me to tell you the state i was in when in that consent that i heard i saw all my hopes mocked 
the words and promises of luscinda proved falsehoods and the recovery of the prize i had 
that instant lost rendered impossible for ever i stood stupefied wholly abandoned it 
seemed by heaven declared the enemy of the earth that bore me the air refusing me breath 
for my sighs the water moisture for my tears it was only the fire that gathered strength 
so that my whole frame glowed with rage and jealousy they were all thrown into confusion 
by luscindas fainting and as her mother was unlacing her to give her air a sealed paper 
was discovered in her bosom which don fernando seized at once and began to read by the light 
of one of the torches as soon as he had read it he seated himself in a chair leaning his cheek 
on his hand in the attitude of one deep in thought without taking any part in the efforts 
that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting fit seeing all the household 
in confusion i ventured to come out regardless whether i were seen or not and determined 
if i were to do some frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation 
of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous don fernando and even in that of the fickle 
fainting traitress but my fate doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows if such there 
be so ordered it that just then i had enough and to spare of that reason which has since been 
wanting to me and so without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest enemies which might 
have been easily taken as all thought of me was so far from their minds i resolved to take 
it upon myself and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved perhaps with even greater 
severity than i should have dealt out to them had i then slain them for sudden pain is soon 
over but that which is protracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life in a 
word i quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom i had left my mule i made him 
saddle it for me mounted without bidding him farewell and rode out of the city like another 
lot not daring to turn my head to look back upon it and when i found myself alone in the open 
country screened by the darkness of the night and tempted by the stillness to give vent 
to my grief without apprehension or fear of being heard or seen then i broke silence and 
lifted up my voice in maledictions upon luscinda and don fernando as if i could thus avenge 
the wrong they had done me i called her cruel ungrateful false thankless but above all 
covetous since the wealth of my enemy had blinded the eyes of her affection and turned 
it from me to transfer it to one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal and yet 
in the midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding i found excuses for her saying 
it was no wonder that a young girl in the seclusion of her parents house trained and schooled 
to obey them always should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they offered her 
for a husband a gentleman of such distinction wealth and noble birth that if she had refused 
to accept him she would have been thought out of her senses or to have set her affection 
elsewhere a suspicion injurious to her fair name and fame but then again i said had she 
declared i was her husband they would have seen that in choosing me she had not chosen so 
ill but that they might excuse her for before don fernando had made his offer they themselves 
could not have desired if their desires had been ruled by reason a more eligible husband 
for their daughter than i was and she before taking the last fatal step of giving her hand 
might easily have said that i had already given her mine for i should have come forward 
to support any assertion of hers to that effect in short i came to the conclusion that feeble 
love little reflection great ambition and a craving for rank had made her forget the words 
with which she had deceived me encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourable 
passion thus soliloquising and agitated i journeyed onward for the remainder of the 
night and by daybreak i reached one of the passes of these mountains among which i wandered 
for three days more without taking any path or road until i came to some meadows lying on 
i know not which side of the mountains and there i inquired of some herdsmen in what direction 
the most rugged part of the mountain sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master 
and longing for him to begin so that there should be no breach of the injunction laid upon 
him but unable to keep silence so long he said to him senor don quixote give me your worships 
blessing and dismissal for id like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom i 
can at any rate talk and converse as much as i like for to want me to go through these solitudes 
day and night and not speak to you when i have a mind is burying me alive if luck would have 
it that animals spoke as they did in the days of guisopete it would not be so bad but i am beginning 
to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost wont be enough to put us right no more 
of that pluck strength out of weakness sancho as i mean to do returned don quixote and let 
us see if rocinante can go and again he spurred him and again rocinante made jumps and remained 
where he was so well tied was he just then whether it was the cold of the morning that was 
now approaching or that he had eaten something laxative at supper or that it was only natural 
as is most likely sancho felt a desire to do what no one could do for him but so great was the 
fear that had penetrated his heart he dared not separate himself from his master by as 
much as the black of his nail to escape doing what he wanted was however also impossible 
so what he did for peaces sake was to remove his right hand which held the back of the saddle 
and with it to untie gently and silently the running string which alone held up his breeches 
so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters he then raised 
his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters no slim ones but this accomplished 
which he fancied was all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait and embarrassment 
another still greater difficulty presented itself for it seemed to him impossible to 
relieve himself without making some noise and he ground his teeth and squeezed his shoulders 
together holding his breath as much as he could but in spite of his precautions he was unlucky 
enough after all to make a little noise very different from that which was causing him 
so much fear don quixote hearing it said what noise is that sancho i dont know senor said 
he it must be something new for adventures and misadventures never begin with a trifle 
once more he tried his luck and succeeded so well that without any further noise or disturbance 
he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so much discomfort but as don 
quixotes sense of smell was as acute as his hearing and as sancho was so closely linked 
with him that the fumes rose almost in a straight line it could not be but that some should 
reach his nose and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing it between his 
fingers saying in a rather snuffing tone sancho it strikes me thou art in great fear i am 
answered sancho but how does your worship perceive it now more than ever because just 
now thou smellest stronger than ever and not of ambergris answered don quixote very likely 
said sancho but thats not my fault but your worships for leading me about at unseasonable 
hours and at such unwonted paces then go back three or four my friend said don quixote all 
the time with his fingers to his nose and for the future pay more attention to thy person 
and to what thou owest to mine for it is my great familiarity with thee that has bred this 
contempt ill bet replied sancho that your worship thinks i have done something i ought 
not with my person it makes it worse to stir it the squire of the grove took sancho by the 
arm saying to him let us two go where we can talk in squire style as much as we please and leave 
these gentlemen our masters to fight it out over the story of their loves and depend upon 
it daybreak will find them at it without having made an end of it so be it by all means said 
sancho and i will tell your worship who i am that you may see whether i am to be reckoned among 
the number of the most talkative squires with this the two squires withdrew to one side 
and between them there passed a conversation as droll as that which passed between their 
masters was serious chapter xiii in which is continued the adventure of the knight of 
the grove chapter xv wherein it is told and known who the knight of the white moon was likewise 
don gregorios release and other events don antonia moreno followed the knight of the 
white moon had been seen from the city and it was told the viceroy how he was in conversation 
with don quixote the viceroy fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by don antonio 
moreno or some other gentleman of the city hurried out at once to the beach accompanied 
by don antonio and several other gentlemen just as don quixote was wheeling rocinante 
round in order to take up the necessary distance the viceroy upon this seeing that the 
pair of them were evidently preparing to come to the charge put himself between them asking 
them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden in this way the knight of 
the white moon was or was it some joke they were playing on don quixote don antonio replied 
that he neither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest this answer 
left the viceroy in a state of perplexity not knowing whether he ought to let the combat 
go on or not but unable to persuade himself that it was anything but a joke he fell back saying 
if there be no other way out of it gallant knights except to confess or die and don quixote 
is inflexible and your worship of the white moon still more so in gods hand be it and fall 
on he of the white moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and wellchosen words for the permission 
he gave them and so did don quixote who then commending himself with all his heart to god 
fancying he was not going to stop until he reached the depths of the bottomless pit but 
it did not turn out so for at little more than thrice a mans height dapple touched bottom 
and he found himself sitting on him without having received any hurt or damage whatever 
he felt himself all over and held his breath to try whether he was quite sound or had a hole 
made in him anywhere and finding himself all right and whole and in perfect health he was 
profuse in his thanks to god our lord for the mercy that had been shown him for he made sure 
he had been broken into a thousand pieces he also felt along the sides of the pit with his 
hands to see if it were possible to get out of it without help but he found they were quite 
smooth and afforded no hold anywhere at which he was greatly distressed especially when 
he heard how pathetically and dolefully dapple was bemoaning himself and no wonder he 
complained nor was it from illtemper for in truth he was not in a very good case alas said 
sancho what unexpected accidents happen at every step to those who live in this miserable 
world who would have said that one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne governor 
of an island giving orders to his servants and his vassals would see himself today buried 
in a pit without a soul to help him or servant or vassal to come to his relief here must we 
perish with hunger my ass and myself if indeed we dont die first he of his bruises and injuries 
and i of grief and sorrow at any rate ill not be as lucky as my master don quixote of la mancha 
the same thats in the history and that they talk about oh my friend said the other let us 
entreat him to stay for it will give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure i too have 
heard just what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries of the other 
and what is more of him they say that he is the most constant and loyal lover that was ever 
heard of and that his lady is one dulcinea del toboso to whom all over spain the palm of beauty 
is awarded and justly awarded said don quixote unless indeed your unequalled beauty 
makes it a matter of doubt but spare yourselves the trouble ladies of pressing me to stay 
for the urgent calls of my profession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances 
at this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brother of one of the two 
shepherdesses like them in shepherd costume and as richly and gaily dressed as they were 
they told him that their companion was the valiant don quixote of la mancha not by cide 
hamete the original author but by an aragonese who by his own account is of tordesillas 
out of this with it said the first and into the depths of hell with it out of my sight is it 
so bad said the other so bad is it said the first that if i had set myself deliberately to 
make a worse i could not have done it they then went on with their game knocking other books 
about and i having heard them mention the name of don quixote whom i love and adore so took 
care to retain this vision in my memory a vision it must have been no doubt said don quixote 
for there is no other i in the world this history has been going about here for some time 
from hand to hand but it does not stay long in any for everybody gives it a taste of his foot 
i am not disturbed by hearing that i am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of 
the pit or in the daylight above for i am not the one that history treats of if it should be 
good faithful and true it will have ages of life but if it should be bad from its birth to 
its burial will not be a very long journey altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint 
against don quixote when he said to her i have several times told you senora that it grieves 
me you should have set your affections upon me as from mine they can only receive gratitude 
but no return i was born to belong to dulcinea del toboso and the fates if there are any dedicated 
me to her and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she occupies in my heart 
is to suppose an impossibility this frank declaration should suffice to make you retire 
within the bounds of your modesty for no one can bind himself to do impossibilities hearing 
this altisidora with a show of anger and agitation exclaimed gods life don stockfish 
soul of a mortar stone of a date more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour 
when he has his mind made up if i fall upon you ill tear your eyes out do you fancy don vanquished 
don cudgelled that i died for your sake all that you have seen tonight has been makebelieve 
im not the woman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel much less die that i can 
well believe said sancho at this for to come out with drolleries is not in everybodys line 
and that sancho your worship speaks of gentle sir must be some great scoundrel dunderhead 
and thief all in one for i am the real sancho panza and i have more drolleries than if it rained 
them let your worship only try come along with me for a year or so and you will find they fall 
from me at every turn and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly i dont know what i am 
saying but the truth is that i am the daughter of diego de la llana whom you must all know 
ay that will do said the majordomo for i know pedro perez very well and i know he has no child 
at all either son or daughter and besides though you say he is your father you add then that 
he comes very often to your fathers house i had already noticed that said sancho i am confused 
just now sirs said the damsel and i dont know what i am saying i make everybody that hears 
me laugh and the real don quixote of la mancha cynosure and morning star of knighterrantry 
despite and in defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your 
achievements as the author of this book which i here present to you has done and with this 
he put a book which his companion carried into the hands of don quixote who took it and without 
replying began to run his eye over it but he presently returned it saying in the little 
i have seen i have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured the 
first is some words that i have read in the preface the next that the language is aragonese 
for sometimes he writes without articles and the third which above all stamps him as ignorant 
is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of the history 
for here he says that my squire sancho panzas wife is called mari gutierrez when she is 
called nothing of the sort but teresa panza and when a man errs on such an important point 
as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the history 
a nice sort of historian indeed exclaimed sancho at this he must know a deal about our affairs 
when he calls my wife teresa panza mari gutierrez take the book again senor and see if i 
am in it and if he has changed my name from your talk friend said don jeronimo no doubt you 
are sancho panza senor don quixotes squire yes i am said sancho and im proud of it faith 
then said the gentleman this new author does not handle you with the decency that displays 
itself in your person he makes you out a heavy feeder and a fool and not in the least droll 
and a very different being from the sancho described in the first part of your masters 
history god forgive him said sancho he might have left me in my corner without troubling 
his head about me let him who knows how ring the bells saint peter is very well in rome i mean 
i am very well in this house where so much is made of me and i hope for such a good thing from 
the master as to see myself a governor friend sancho said the duke at this the island that 
i have promised you is not a moving one or one that will run away it has roots so deeply buried 
in the bowels of the earth to escape the holy brotherhood which no doubt will come out in 
search of us what your worship may do and fairly do is to change this service and tribute 
as regards the lady dulcinea del toboso for judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her 
beauty she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world she wept as she went and 
embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those who came out to see her and she begged 
them all to commend her to god and our lady his mother and this in such a touching way that 
it made me weep myself though im not much given to tears commonly and faith many a one would 
have liked to hide her or go out and carry her off on the road but the fear of going against 
the kings command kept them back the one who showed himself most moved was don pedro gregorio 
the rich young heir thou knowest of and they say he was deep in love with her and since she 
left he has not been seen in our village again and we all suspect he has gone after her to 
steal her away but so far nothing has been heard of it i always had a suspicion that gentleman 
had a passion for my daughter said ricote but as i felt sure of my ricotas virtue it gave 
me no uneasiness to know that he loved her for thou must have heard it said sancho that the 
morisco women seldom or never engage in amours with the old christians and my daughter 
who i fancy thought more of being a christian than of lovemaking would not trouble herself 
about the attentions of this heir god grant it said sancho for it would be a bad business 
for us and so saying he turned about and began i cannot say to run but to fly in less than six 
paces i fell from fright and then the officer of justice came up and carried me before your 
worships where i find myself put to shame before all these people as whimsical and vicious 
so then senora said sancho no other mishap has befallen you nor was it jealousy that made 
you leave home as you said at the beginning of your story nothing has happened me said she 
nor was it jealousy that brought me out but merely a longing to see the world which did not 
go beyond seeing the streets of this town the appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother 
in custody whom one of them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister now fully confirmed 
the truth of what the damsel said he had nothing on but a rich petticoat and a short blue 
damask cloak with fine gold lace and his head was uncovered and adorned only with its own 
hair which looked like rings of gold so bright and curly was it the governor the majordomo 
and the carver went aside with him and unheard by his sister asked him how he came to be in 
that dress and he with no less shame and embarrassment told exactly the same story as his 
sister to the great delight of the enamoured carver the governor however said to them 
in truth young lady and gentleman this has been a very childish affair and to explain your 
folly and rashness there was no necessity for all this delay and all these tears and sighs 
for if you had said we are soandso and we escaped from our fathers house in this way in order 
to ramble about out of mere curiosity and with no other object there would have been an 
end of the matter and none of these little sobs and tears and all the rest of it that is true 
said the majordomo and i maintain that lycurgus himself who gave laws to the lacedemonians 
could not have pronounced a better decision than the great panza has given let the mornings 
audience close with this and i will see that the senor governor has dinner entirely to 
his liking thats all i ask forfair play said sancho give me my dinner and then let it rain 
cases and questions on me and ill despatch them in a twinkling the majordomo kept his word 
for he felt it against his conscience to kill so wise a governor by hunger particularly 
as he intended to have done with him that same night playing off the last joke he was commissioned 
to practise upon him it came to pass then that having sallied forth one morning to practise 
and exercise himself in what he would have to do in the encounter he expected to find himself 
engaged in the next day as he was putting rocinante through his paces or pressing him to 
the charge he brought his feet so close to a pit that but for reining him in tightly it would 
have been impossible for me so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this 
purpose which i feel to be as righteous as to thee dear father it seems wicked but neither 
could her father hear her nor we see him when she said this and so while i consoled zoraida 
we turned our attention to our voyage in which a breeze from the right point so favoured 
us that we made sure of finding ourselves off the coast of spain on the morrow by daybreak 
but as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed without being attended or followed 
by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it our fortune or perhaps the curses which 
the moor had hurled at his daughter for whatever kind of father they may come from these 
are always to be dreaded brought it about that when we were now in midsea and the night about 
three hours spent as we were running with all sail set and oars lashed for the favouring 
breeze saved us the trouble of using them we saw by the light of the moon which shone brilliantly 
a squarerigged vessel in full sail close to us luffing up and standing across our course 
and so close that we had to strike sail to avoid running foul of her while they too put the 
helm hard up to let us pass they came to the side of the ship to ask who we were whither we were 
bound and whence we came but as they asked this in french our renegade said let no one answer 
for no doubt these are french corsairs who plunder all comers acting on this warning no 
one answered a word but after we had gone a little ahead and the vessel was now lying to leeward 
suddenly they fired two guns and apparently both loaded with chainshot for with one they 
cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the sea and the other discharged 
at the same moment sent a ball into our vessel amidships staving her in completely but 
without doing any further damage we however finding ourselves sinking began to shout 
for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill they then 
lay to and lowering a skiff or boat as many as a dozen frenchmen well armed with matchlocks 
and their matches burning got into it and came alongside and seeing how few we were and 
that our vessel was going down they took us in telling us that this had come to us through 
our incivility in not giving them an answer our renegade took the trunk containing zoraidas 
wealth and dropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he did in short we went 
on board with the frenchmen who after having ascertained all they wanted to know about 
us rifled us of everything we had as if they had been our bitterest enemies and from zoraida 
they took even the anklets she wore on her feet but the distress they caused her did not 
distress me so much as the fear i was in that from robbing her of her rich and precious jewels 
they would proceed to rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more than all the 
desires however of those people do not go beyond money but of that their covetousness 
is insatiable and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch that they would have taken 
even the clothes we wore as captives if they had been worth anything to them it was the advice 
of some of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail for their purpose was to trade 
at some of the ports of spain giving themselves out as bretons and if they brought us alive 
they would be punished as soon as the robbery was discovered but the captain who was the 
one who had plundered my beloved zoraida said he was satisfied with the prize he had got 
and that he would not touch at any spanish port but pass the straits of gibraltar by night 
or as best he could and make for la rochelle from which he had sailed so they agreed by common 
consent to give us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required for the short voyage 
that remained to us and this they did the next day on coming in sight of the spanish coast 
with which and the joy we felt all our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten 
as if they had never been endured by us such is the delight of recovering lost liberty it 
may have been about midday when they placed us in the boat giving us two kegs of water and 
some biscuit and the captain moved by i know not what compassion as the lovely zoraida 
was about to embark gave her some forty gold crowns and would not permit his men to take 
from her those same garments which she has on now we got into the boat returning them thanks 
for their kindness to us and showing ourselves grateful rather than indignant they stood 
out to sea steering for the straits we without looking to any compass save the land we had 
before us set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so near that we might 
easily we thought land before the night was far advanced but as the moon did not show that 
night and the sky was clouded and as we knew not whereabouts we were it did not seem to us 
a prudent thing to make for the shore as several of us advised saying we ought to run ourselves 
ashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation for in this way we should be relieved 
from the apprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the tetuan corsairs 
who leave barbary at nightfall and are on the spanish coast by daybreak where they commonly 
take some prize and then go home to sleep in their own houses but of the conflicting counsels 
the one which was adopted was that we should approach gradually and land where we could 
if the sea were calm enough to permit us this was done and a little before midnight we drew 
near to the foot of a huge and lofty mountain not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow 
space on which to land conveniently we ran our boat up on the sand and all sprang out and 
kissed the ground and with tears of joyful satisfaction returned thanks to god our lord 
for the mercy that had been shown him for he made sure he had been broken into a thousand 
pieces he also felt along the sides of the pit with his hands to see if it were possible to 
get out of it without help but he found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere 
at which he was greatly distressed especially when he heard how pathetically and dolefully 
dapple was bemoaning himself and no wonder he complained nor was it from illtemper for 
in truth he was not in a very good case alas said sancho what unexpected accidents happen 
at every step to those who live in this miserable world who would have said that one who 
saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne governor of an island giving orders to his servants 
and his vassals would see himself today buried in a pit without a soul to help him or servant 
or vassal to come to his relief here must we perish with hunger my ass and myself if indeed 
we dont die first he of his bruises and injuries and i of grief and sorrow at any rate ill 
not be as lucky as my master don quixote of la mancha when he went down into the cave of that 
enchanted montesinos where he found people to make more of him than if he had been in his 
own house for it seems he came in for a table laid out and a bed ready made there he saw fair 
and pleasant visions but here ill see i imagine toads and adders unlucky wretch that i 
am what an end my follies and fancies have come to theyll take up my bones out of this when 
it is heavens will that im found picked clean white and polished and my good dapples with 
them and by that perhaps it will be found out who we are at least by such as have heard that 
sancho panza never separated from his ass nor his ass from sancho panza unlucky wretches 
i say again that our hard fate should not let us die in our own country and among our own people 
where if there was no help for our misfortune at any rate there would be some one to grieve 
for it and to close our eyes as we passed away o comrade and friend how ill have i repaid thy 
faithful services forgive me and entreat fortune as well as thou canst to deliver us out 
of this miserable strait we are both in and i promise to put a crown of laurel on thy head 
and make thee look like a poet laureate and give thee double feeds in this strain did sancho 
bewail himself and his ass listened to him but answered him never a word such was the distress 
and anguish the poor beast found himself in at length after a night spent in bitter moanings 
and lamentations day came and by its light sancho perceived that it was wholly impossible 
to escape out of that pit without help and he fell to bemoaning his fate and uttering loud 
shouts to find out if there was anyone within hearing but all his shouting was only crying 
in the wilderness for there was not a soul anywhere in the neighbourhood to hear him and 
then at last he gave himself up for dead dapple was lying on his back and sancho helped him 
to his feet which he was scarcely able to keep and then taking a piece of bread out of his 
alforjas which had shared their fortunes in the fall he gave it to the ass to whom it was 
not unwelcome saying to him as if he understood him with bread all sorrows are less and 
now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to admit a person if he stooped 
and squeezed himself into a small compass sancho made for it and entered it by creeping 
and found it wide and spacious on the inside which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight 
that penetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly he observed too that 
it opened and widened out into another spacious cavity seeing which he made his way back 
to where the ass was and with a stone began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short 
time he had made room for the beast to pass easily and this accomplished taking him by the 
halter he proceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was any outlet at the other end 
he advanced sometimes in the dark sometimes without light but never without fear god 
almighty help me said he to himself this that is a misadventure to me would make a good adventure 
for my master don quixote he would have been sure to take these depths and dungeons for 
flowery gardens or the palaces of galiana and would have counted upon issuing out of this 
darkness and imprisonment into some blooming meadow but i unlucky that i am hopeless 
and spiritless expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to open under my 
feet and swallow me up for good welcome evil if thou comest alone in this way and with these 
reflections he seemed to himself to have travelled rather more than half a league when 
at last he perceived a dim light that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side 
showing that this road which appeared to him the road to the other world led to some opening 
here cide hamete leaves him and returns to don quixote who in high spirits and satisfaction 
was looking forward to the day fixed for the battle he was to fight with him who had robbed 
dona rodriguezs daughter of her honour for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for the 
wrong and injury shamefully done to her it came to pass then that after he had dined that 
day in opposition to the rules and aphorisms of doctor tirteafuera as they were taking 
away the cloth there came a courier with a letter from don quixote for the governor sancho 
ordered the secretary to read it to himself and if there was nothing in it that demanded 
secrecy to read it aloud the secretary did so and after he had skimmed the contents he said 
it may well be read aloud for what senor don quixote writes to your worship deserves to 
be printed or written in letters of gold and it is as follows don quixote of la manchas letter 
to sancho panza governor of the island of barataria into his own hands or those of his secretary 
sancho when he heard this said which of you is my secretary i am senor said one of those present 
for i can read and write and am a biscayan with that addition said sancho you might be secretary 
to the emperor himself open this paper and see what it says the newborn secretary obeyed 
and having read the contents said the matter was one to be discussed in private sancho 
ordered the chamber to be cleared the majordomo and the carver only remaining so the doctor 
and the others withdrew and then the secretary read the letter which was as follows it 
has come to my knowledge senor don sancho panza that certain enemies of mine and of the 
island are about to make a furious attack upon it some night i know not when it behoves you 
to be on the alert and keep watch that they surprise you not i also know by trustworthy spies 
that four persons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life because 
they stand in dread of your great capacity keep your eyes open and take heed who approaches 
you to address you and eat nothing that is presented to you i will take care to send you some 
good things to eat and be sure you eat them for i would have you know i am convinced as one 
who has gone through it that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty 
and the brains full of wind take courage take courage for despondency in misfortune breaks 
down health and brings on death to all these words of the licentiate another madman in 
a cage opposite that of the furious one was listening and raising himself up from an old 
mat on which he lay stark naked he asked in a loud voice who it was that was going away cured 
and in his senses the licentiate answered it is i brother who am going i have now no need 
to remain here any longer for which i return infinite thanks to heaven that has had so great 
mercy upon me mind what you are saying licentiate dont let the devil deceive you replied 
the madman keep quiet stay where you are and you will save yourself the trouble of coming 
back i know i am cured returned the licentiate and that i shall not have to go stations again 
you cured said the madman well we shall see god be with you but i swear to you by jupiter whose 
majesty i represent on earth that for this crime alone which seville is committing today 
in releasing you from this house and treating you as if you were in your senses i shall have 
to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages and ages amen dost thou 
not know thou miserable little licentiate that i can do it being as i say jupiter the thunderer 
who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which i am able and am wont to threaten and lay waste 
the world but in one way only will i punish this ignorant town and that is by not raining 
upon it nor on any part of its district or territory for three whole years to be reckoned 
from the day and moment when this threat is pronounced thou free thou cured thou in thy 
senses and i mad i disordered i bound i will as soon think of sending rain as of hanging myself 
those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the madman but our licentiate 
turning to the chaplain and seizing him by the hands said to him be not uneasy senor attach 
no importance to what this madman has said for if he is jupiter and will not send rain i who 
am neptune the father and god of the waters will rain as often as it pleases me and may be 
needful the governor and the bystanders laughed and at their laughter the chaplain was 
half ashamed and he replied for all that senor neptune it will not do to vex senor jupiter 
remain where you are and some other day when there is a better opportunity and more time 
we will come back for you so they stripped the licentiate and he was left where he was and 
thats the end of the story so thats the story master barber said don quixote which came 
in so pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it master shaver master shaver 
how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve is it possible that you do not know that comparisons 
of wit with wit valour with valour beauty with beauty birth with birth are always odious 
and unwelcome i master barber am not neptune the god of the waters nor do i try to make anyone 
take me for an astute man for i am not one my only endeavour is to convince the world of the 
mistake it makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of knighterrantry 
was in the field but our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a blessing as those 
ages enjoyed when knightserrant took upon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms the 
protection of damsels the succour of orphans and minors the chastisement of the proud 
and the recompense of the humble with the knights of these days for the most part it is the 
damask brocade and rich stuffs they wear that rustle as they go not the chain mail of their 
armour no knight nowadays sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven 
and in full panoply from head to foot no one now takes a nap as they call it without drawing 
his feet out of the stirrups and leaning upon his lance as the knightserrant used to do 
no one now issuing from the wood penetrates yonder mountains and then treads the barren 
lonely shore of the seamostly a tempestuous and stormy oneand finding on the beach a little 
bark without oars sail mast or tackling of any kind in the intrepidity of his heart flings 
himself into it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea that one moment 
lift him up to heaven and the next plunge him into the depths and opposing his breast to 
the irresistible gale finds himself when he least expects it three thousand leagues 
and more away from the place where he embarked and leaping ashore in a remote and unknown 
land has adventures that deserve to be written not on parchment but on brass but now sloth 
triumphs over energy indolence over exertion vice over virtue arrogance over courage 
and theory over practice in arms which flourished and shone only in the golden ages and 
in knightserrant for tell me who was more virtuous and more valiant than the famous amadis 
of gaul who more discreet than palmerin of england who more gracious and easy than tirante 
el blanco who more courtly than lisuarte of greece who more slashed or slashing than don 
belianis who more intrepid than perion of gaul who more ready to face danger than felixmarte 
of hircania who more sincere than esplandian who more impetuous than don cirongilio 
of thrace who more bold than rodamonte who more prudent than king sobrino who more daring 
than reinaldos who more invincible than roland and who more gallant and courteous than 
ruggiero from whom the dukes of ferrara of the present day are descended according to 
turpin in his cosmography all these knights and many more that i could name senor curate 
were knightserrant the light and glory of chivalry these or such as these i would have 
to carry out my plan and in that case his majesty would find himself well served and would 
save great expense and the turk would be left tearing his beard and so i will stay where 
i am as the chaplain does not take me away and if jupiter as the barber has told us will not 
send rain here am i and i will rain when i please i say this that master basin may know that 
i understand him indeed senor don quixote said the duchess is nearly suppertime and the 
duke is is probably waiting come let us go to supper and retire to rest early for the journey 
you made yesterday from kandy was not such a short one but that it must have caused you some 
fatigue i feel none senora said don quixote for i would go so far as to swear to your excellence 
that in all my life i never mounted a quieter beast or a pleasanter paced one than clavileno 
and i dont know what could have induced malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so gentle 
and burn it so recklessly as he did probably said the duchess repenting of the evil he had 
done to the trifaldi and company and others and the crimes he must have committed as a wizard 
and enchanter he resolved to make away with all the instruments of his craft and so burned 
clavileno as the chief one and that which mainly kept him restless wandering from land 
to land and by its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great don quixote 
of la mancha is the cat however never minding these threats snarled and held on but at last 
the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window don quixote was left with a face as full 
of holes as a sieve and a nose not in very good condition and greatly vexed that they did 
not let him finish his battle he would kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent 
him the lady in the coach amazed and terrified at what she saw ordered the coachman to draw 
aside a little and set herself to watch this severe struggle in the course of which the 
biscayan smote don quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler 
which given to one without armour would have cleft him to the waist don quixote feeling 
the weight of this prodigious blow cried aloud saying o lady of my soul dulcinea flower 
of beauty come to the aid of this your knight who in fulfilling his obligations to your 
beauty finds himself in this extreme peril to say this to lift his sword to shelter himself 
well behind his buckler and to assail the biscayan was the work of an instant determined 
as he was to venture all upon a single blow the biscayan seeing him come on in this way was 
convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing and resolved to follow his example so 
he waited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion being unable to execute any sort 
of manoeuvre with his mule which dead tired and never meant for this kind of game could 
not stir a step on then as aforesaid came don quixote against the wary biscayan with uplifted 
sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half while on his side the biscayan waited 
for him sword in hand and under the protection of his cushion and all present stood trembling 
waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall and the lady in the coach 
and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all the images 
and shrines of spain that god might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril 
in which they found themselves but it spoils all that at this point and crisis the author 
of the history leaves this battle impending giving as excuse that he could find nothing 
more written about these achievements of don quixote than what has been already set forth 
it is true the second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious 
could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion or that the wits of la mancha 
could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some 
documents referring to this famous knight and this being his persuasion he did not despair 
of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history which heaven favouring him he did 
find in a way that shall be related in the second part chapter ix in which is concluded and 
finished the terrific battle between the gallant biscayan and the valiant manchegan 
in the first part of this great as well as accurate history in the last chapter thereof 
so they resolved to pay him a visit and test the improvement in his condition although 
they thought it almost impossible that there could be any and they agreed not to touch 
upon any point connected with knighterrantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds 
which were still so tender they came to see him consequently and found him sitting up in 
bed in a green baize waistcoat and a red toledo cap and so withered and dried up that he looked 
as if he had been turned into a mummy they were very cordially received by him they asked 
him after his health and he talked to them about himself very naturally and in very wellchosen 
language in the course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call statecraft 
and systems of government correcting this abuse and condemning that reforming one practice 
and abolishing another each of the three setting up for a new legislator a modern lycurgus 
or a brandnew solon and so completely did they remodel the state that they seemed to have 
thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite different from what they had put 
in and on all the subjects they dealt with don quixote spoke with such good sense that the 
pair of examiners were fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses 
the niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not find words enough 
to express their thanks to god at seeing their master so clear in his mind the curate however 
changing his original plan which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry resolved 
to test don quixotes recovery thoroughly and see whether it were genuine or not and so 
from one subject to another he came at last to talk of the news that had come from the capital 
and among other things he said it was considered certain that the turk was coming down 
with a powerful fleet and that no one knew what his purpose was or when the great storm would 
burst and that all christendom was in apprehension of this which almost every year calls 
us to arms and that his majesty had made provision for the security of the coasts of naples 
and sicily and the island of malta to this don quixote replied his majesty has acted like 
a prudent warrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time so that the enemy may 
not find him unprepared but if my advice were taken i would recommend him to adopt a measure 
which at present no doubt his majesty is very far from thinking of the moment the curate 
heard this he said to himself god keep thee in his hand poor don quixote for it seems to me 
thou art becoming sicut erat again speak in a plain simple straightforward way as i have 
often told thee and thou wilt find the good of it i dont know what bad luck it is of mine argument 
to my mind however i mean to mend if i can and so for the present the conversation ended chapter 
lxxii of how don quixote and sancho reached their village all that day don quixote and 
sancho remained in the village and inn waiting for night the one to finish off his task 
of scourging in the open country the other to see it accomplished for therein lay the accomplishment 
of his wishes meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a traveller on horseback with three 
or four servants one of whom said to him who appeared to be the master here senor don alvaro 
tarfe your worship may take your siesta today the quarters seem clean and cool when he 
heard this don quixote said to sancho look here sancho on turning over the leaves of that 
book of the second part of my history i think i came casually upon this name of don alvaro 
tarfe very likely said sancho we had better let him dismount and byandby we can ask about 
it the gentleman dismounted and the landlady gave him a room on the ground floor where 
in place of leather hangings there were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly 
use in villages on one of them was painted by some very poor hand the rape of helen when the 
bold guest carried her off from menelaus and on the other was the story of dido and aeneas 
she on a high tower as though she were making signals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest 
who was out at sea flying in a frigate or brigantine he noticed in the two stories that helen 
did not go very reluctantly for she was laughing slyly and roguishly but the fair dido 
was shown dropping tears the size of walnuts from her eyes don quixote as he looked at them 
observed those two ladies were very unfortunate not to have been born in theirs had i fallen 
in with those gentlemen troy would not have been burned or carthage destroyed for it would 
have been only for me to slay paris and all these misfortunes would have been avoided ill 
lay a bet said sancho that before long there wont be a tavern roadside inn hostelry or barbers 
shop where the story of our doings wont be painted up but id like it painted by the hand of 
a better painter than painted these thou art right sancho said don quixote for this painter 
is like orbaneja a painter there was at ubeda who when they asked him what he was painting 
answered what it may turn out sometimes he would paint a cock in such a fashion and so unlike 
that he had to write alongside of it in gothic letters this is a cock and so it will be with 
my history which will require a commentary to make it intelligible no fear of that returned 
samson for it is so plain that there is nothing in it to puzzle over the children turn its 
leaves the young people read it the grown men understand it the old folk praise it in a word 
it is so thumbed and read and got by heart by people of all sorts that the instant they see 
any lean hack they say there goes rocinante and those that are most given to reading it 
are the pages for there is not a lords antechamber where there is not a don quixote to be 
found one takes it up if another lays it down this one pounces upon it and that begs for it 
in short the said history is the most delightful and least injurious entertainment that 
has been hitherto seen for there is not to be found in a duenna i have no doubt said the duchess 
that my good dona rodriguez is right and very much so but she had better bide her time for 
fighting her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas so as to crush the calumny of 
that vile apothecary and root out the prejudice in the great sancho panzas mind to which 
sancho replied ever since i have sniffed the governorship i have got rid of the humours 
of a squire and i dont care a wild fig for all the duennas in the world they would have carried 
on this duenna dispute further had they not heard the notes of the fife and drums once more 
from which they concluded that the distressed duenna was making her entrance the duchess 
asked the duke if it would be possible to find cardenio as he felt the greatest anxiety 
to know the end of his story the goatherd told him as he had told him before that there was 
no knowing of a certainty where his lair was but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood 
he could not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses chapter xxv which treats 
of the strange things that happened to the stout knight of la mancha in the sierra morena 
and of his imitation of the penance of beltenebros don quixote took leave of the duke and 
of what followed with the witty and impudent altisidora one of the duchesss damsels don 
quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such misery lest he should end it there which 
would be the greatest of all misfortunes cardenio was then in his right mind free from 
any attack of that madness which so frequently carried him away and seeing them dressed 
in a fashion so unusual among the frequenters of those wilds could not help showing some 
surprise especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a wellknown matter 
for the curates words gave him to understand as much so he replied to them thus i see plainly 
sirs whoever you may be that heaven whose care it is to succour the good and even the wicked 
very often here in this remote spot cut off from human intercourse sends me though i deserve 
it not those who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat showing me by many 
and forcible arguments how unreasonably i act in leading the life i do but as they know 
that if i escape from this evil i shall fall into another still greater perhaps they will 
set me down as a weakminded man or what is worse one devoid of reason nor would it be any wonder 
for i myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great 
and works so powerfully to my ruin that in spite of myself i become at times like a stone 
without feeling or consciousness and i come to feel the truth of it when they tell me and 
show me proofs of the things i have done when the terrible fit overmasters me and all i can 
do is bewail my lot in vain and idly curse my destiny and plead for my madness by telling 
how it was caused to any that care to hear it for no reasonable beings on learning the cause 
will wonder at the effects and if they cannot help me at least they will not blame me and 
the repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes if it be sirs that 
you are here with the same design as others have come wah before you proceed with your wise 
arguments i entreat you to hear the story of my countless misfortunes for perhaps when 
you have heard it you will spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering consolation 
to grief that is beyond the reach of it as they both of them desired nothing more than to 
hear from his own lips the cause of his suffering they entreated him to tell it promising 
not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish and thereupon the unhappy 
gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same words and manner in which he had related 
it to don quixote and the goatherd a few days before when through master elisabad and don 
quixotes scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry the tale was left unfinished 
as this history has already recorded but now fortunately the mad fit kept off allowed 
him to tell it to the end and so coming to the incident of the note which don fernando had 
found in the volume of amadis of gaul cardenio said that he remembered it perfectly and 
that it was in these words luscinda to cardenio every day i discover merits in you that 
oblige and compel me to hold you in higher estimation so if you desire to relieve me of this 
obligation without cost to my honour you may easily do so i have a father who knows you and 
loves me dearly who without putting any constraint on my inclination will grant what 
will be reasonable for you to have if it be that you value me as you say and as i believe you 
do by this letter i was induced as i told you to demand luscinda for my wife and it was through 
it that luscinda came to be regarded by don fernando as one of the most discreet and prudent 
women of the day and this letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine 
could be carried into effect i told don fernando that all luscindas father was waiting 
for was that mine should ask her of him which i did not dare to suggest to him fearing that 
he would not consent to do so not because he did not know perfectly well the rank goodness 
virtue and beauty of luscinda and that she had qualities that would do honour to any family 
in spain but because i was aware that he did not wish me to marry so soon before seeing what 
the duke ricardo would do for me in short i told him i did not venture to mention it to my father 
as well on account of that difficulty as of many others that discouraged me though i knew 
not well what they were only that it seemed to me that what i desired was never to come to 
pass to all this don fernando answered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my 
father and the price of which he now desired me to fetch could i have anticipated this treachery 
could i by any chance have suspected it nay so far from that i offered with the greatest 
pleasure to go at once in my satisfaction at the good bargain that had been made that night 
i spoke with luscinda and told her what had been agreed upon with don fernando and how i 
had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes being realised she as unsuspicious 
as i was of the treachery of don fernando bade me try to return speedily as she believed 
the fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father put off speaking 
to hers i know not why it was that on saying this to me her eyes filled with tears and there 
came a lump in her throat that prevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed 
to me she was striving to say to me i was astonished at this unusual turn which i never before 
observed in her for we always conversed whenever good fortune and my ingenuity gave us 
the chance with the greatest gaiety and cheerfulness mingling tears sighs jealousies 
doubts or fears with our words it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune that heaven 
should have given her to me for my mistress i glorified her beauty i extolled her worth 
and her understanding and she paid me back by praising in me what in her love for me she thought 
worthy of praise and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our neighbours 
and acquaintances to talk about and the utmost extent of my boldness was to take almost 
by force one of her fair white hands and carry it to my lips as well as the closeness of the 
low grating that separated us allowed me but the night before the unhappy day of my departure 
she wept she moaned she sighed and she withdrew leaving me filled with perplexity and 
amazement overwhelmed at the sight of such strange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow 
in luscinda but not to dash my hopes i ascribed it all to the depth of her love for me and the 
pain that separation gives those who love tenderly at last i took my departure sad and 
dejected my heart filled with fancies and suspicions but not knowing well what it was 
i suspected or fancied plain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaiting 
me i reached the place whither i had been sent gave the letter to don fernandos brother 
and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed for he desired me to wait very much 
against my will eight days in some place where the duke his father was not likely to see 
me as his brother wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge all of which 
was a scheme of the treacherous don fernando for his brother had no want of money to enable 
him to despatch me at once the command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying 
it as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separated from luscinda 
especially after leaving her in the sorrowful mood i have described to you nevertheless 
as a dutiful servant i obeyed though i felt it would be at the cost of my wellbeing but four 
days later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which he gave me and which by the address 
i perceived to be from luscinda as the writing was hers i opened it with fear and trepidation 
persuaded that it must be something serious that had impelled her to write to me when at 
a distance as she seldom did so when i was near before reading it i asked the man who it was 
that had given it to him and how long he had been upon the road he told me that as he happened 
to be passing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon a very beautiful 
lady called to him from a window and with tears in her eyes said to me in a low agitated voice 
my lady dulcinea del toboso kisses your worships hands and entreats you to do her the favour 
of releasing the moors and setting her father at liberty for she would rather drown herself 
in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be carried away captive before 
her eyes and on her account the renegade repeated this to me and i replied that i was very 
willing to do so but he replied that it was not advisable because if they were left there 
they would at once raise the country and stir up the city and lead to the despatch of swift 
cruisers in pursuit and our being taken by sea or land without any possibility of escape 
and that all that could be done was to set them free on the first christian ground we reached 
on this point we all agreed and zoraida to whom it was explained together with the reasons 
that prevented us from doing at once what she desired was satisfied likewise and then 
in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his oar and commending 
ourselves to god with all our hearts we began to shape our course for the island of majorca 
the nearest christian land owing however to the tramontana rising a little and the sea 
growing somewhat rough it was impossible for us to keep a straight course for majorca 
and we were compelled to coast in the direction of oran not without great uneasiness on 
our part lest we should be observed from the town of shershel which lies on that coast not 
more than sixty miles from algiers moreover we were afraid of meeting on that course one 
of the galliots that usually come with goods from tetuan although each of us for himself 
and all of us together felt confident that if we were to meet a merchant galliot so that 
it were not a cruiser not only should we not be lost but that we should take a vessel in which 
we could more safely accomplish our voyage as we pursued our course zoraida kept her head 
between my hands so as not to see her father and i felt that she was praying to lela marien 
to help us we might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three musketshots 
off the land which seemed to us deserted and without anyone to see us for all that however 
by hard rowing we put out a little to sea for it was now somewhat calmer and having gained 
about two leagues the word was given to row by batches while we ate something for the vessel 
was well provided but the rowers said it was not a time to take any rest let food be served 
out to those who were not rowing but they would not leave their oars on any account this 
was done but now a stiff breeze began to blow which obliged us to leave off rowing and make 
sail at once and steer for oran as it was impossible to make any other course all this was 
done very promptly and under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear 
except that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition we gave the moorish 
rowers some food and the renegade comforted them by telling them that they were not held 
as captives as we should set them free on the first christian ground we reached on this 
point we all agreed and zoraida to whom it was explained together with the reasons that 
prevented us from doing at once what she desired was satisfied likewise and then in glad 
silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his oar and commending

as captives as we should set them free on the first opportunity the same was said to zoraidas 
father who replied anything else christian i might hope for or think likely from your 
generosity and good behaviour but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give 
me my liberty for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of depriving me 
of it only to restore it to me so generously especially as you know who i am and the sum you 
may expect to receive on restoring it and if you will only name that i here offer you all 
you require for myself and for my unhappy daughter there or else for her alone for she is 
the greatest and most precious part of my soul as he said this he began to weep so bitterly 
that he filled us all with compassion and forced zoraida to look at him and when she saw 
him weeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw her arms round him 
and pressing her face to his they both gave way to such an outburst of tears that several 
of us were constrained to keep them company but when her father saw her in full dress and 
with all her jewels about her he said to her in his own language what means this my daughter 
last night before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged befell us i saw thee 
in thy everyday and indoor garments and now without having had time to attire thyself 
and without my bringing thee any joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and 
bedecking thyself i see thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my power to give 
him the island i have promised or any equivalent for it at least his wages shall not be lost 
for in my will which is already made i have declared the sum that shall be paid to him measured 
not by his many faithful services but by the means at my disposal sancho bowed his head 
very respectfully and kissed both his hands for being tied together he could not kiss 
one and then the apparitions lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the 
oxcart chapter xlvii of the strange manner in which don quixote of la mancha was carried 
away enchanted together with other remarkable incidents when don quixote saw himself 
caged and hoisted on the cart in this way he said many grave histories of knightserrant 
have i read but never yet have i read seen or heard of their carrying off enchanted knightserrant 
in this fashion or at the slow pace that these lazy sluggish animals promise for they always 
take them away through the air with marvellous swiftness enveloped in a dark thick cloud 
or on a chariot of fire or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind but to carry 
me off like this on an oxcart by god it puzzles me but perhaps the chivalry and enchantments 
of our day take a different course from that of those in days gone by and it may be too that 
as i am a new knight in the world and the first to revive the already forgotten calling of 
knightadventurers they may have newly invented other kinds of enchantments and other 
modes of carrying off the enchanted what thinkest thou of the matter sancho my son i dont 
know what to think of it for here they tell me that the governors that come to this island 
before entering it have plenty of money either given to them or lent to them by the people 
of the town and that this is the usual custom not only here but with all who enter upon governments 
last night going the rounds i came upon a fair damsel in mans clothes and a brother of hers 
dressed as a woman my headcarver has fallen in love with the girl and has in his own mind 
chosen her for a wife so he says and i have chosen youth for a soninlaw today we are going 
to explain our intentions to the father of the pair who is one diego de la llana a gentleman 
and an old christian as much as you please i have visited the marketplaces as your worship 
advises me and yesterday i found a stallkeeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to 
have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new i confiscated the whole 
for the children of the charityschool who will know how to distinguish them well enough 
and i sentenced her not to come into the marketplace for a fortnight they told me i did bravely 
i can tell your worship it is commonly said in this town that there are no people worse than 
the marketwomen for they are all barefaced unconscionable and impudent and i can well 
believe it from what i have seen of them in other towns i am very glad my lady the duchess 
has written to my wife teresa panza and sent her the present your worship speaks of and 
i will strive to show myself grateful when the time comes kiss her hands for me and tell 
her i say she has not thrown it into a sack with a hole in it as she will see in the end i should 
not like your worship to have any difference with my lord and lady for if you fall out with 
them it is plain it must do me harm and as you give me advice to be grateful it will not do for 
your worship not to be so yourself to those who have shown you such kindness and by whom 
you have been treated so hospitably in their castle that about the scratching i dont understand 
but i suppose it must be one of the illturns the wicked enchanters are always doing your 
worship when we meet i shall know all about it i wish i could send your worship something 
but i dont know what to say my son replied don diego all i can tell thee is that i have seen 
him act the acts of the greatest madman in the world and heard him make observations so 
sensible that they efface and undo all he does do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his 
wits and as thou art shrewd form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to his wisdom 
or folly though to tell the truth i never perceived her ugliness but only her beauty which 
was raised to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip like a moustache 
with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold and more than a palm long from the correspondence 
which exists between those of the face and those of the body said don quixote dulcinea 
must have another mole resembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she 
has the one on her ace but hairs of the length thou hast mentioned are very long for moles 
well all i can say is there they were as plain as could be replied sancho i believe it my friend 
returned don quixote for nature bestowed nothing on dulcinea that was not perfect and 
wellfinished and so if she had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described in her they 
would not be moles but moons and shining stars but tell me sancho that which seemed to me 
to be a packsaddle as thou wert fixing it was it a flatsaddle or a sidesaddle it was neither 
replied sancho but a jineta saddle with a field covering worth half a kingdom so rich is 
it and that i could not see all this sancho said don quixote once more i say and will say a 
thousand times i am the most unfortunate of men sancho the rogue had enough to do to hide 
his laughter at hearing the simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled at length 
after a good deal more conversation had passed between them they remounted their beasts 
and followed the road to saragossa which they expected to reach in time to take part in 
a certain grand festival which is held every year in that illustrious city but before 
they got there things happened to them so many so important and so strange that they deserve 
to be recorded and read as will be seen farther on chapter l wherein is set forth who the 
enchanters and executioners were who flogged the duenna and pinched don quixote and 
also what befell the page who carried the letter to teresa panza sancho panzas wife chapter 
li of the progress of sanchos government and other such entertaining matters day came 
after the night of the governors round a night which the headcarver passed without sleeping 
so were his thoughts of the face and air and beauty of the disguised damsel while the majordomo 
spent what was left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all sancho said and 
did being as much amazed at his sayings as at his doings for there was a mixture of shrewdness 
and simplicity in all his words and deeds the senor governor got up and by doctor pedro 
recios directions they made him break his fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold 
water which sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes 
but seeing there was no help for it the landlady the landlord their daughter and maritornes 
when they saw don quixote and sancho coming went out to welcome them with signs of hearty 
satisfaction which don quixote received with dignity and gravity and bade them make 
up a better bed for him than the last time to which the landlady replied that if he paid better 
than he did the last time she would give him one fit for a prince don quixote said he would 
so they made up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before and he lay down at once 
being sorely shaken and in want of sleep no sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady 
made at the barber and seizing him by the beard said by my faith you are not going to make 
a beard of my tail any longer you must give me back tail for it is a shame the way that thing 
of my husbands goes tossing about on the floor i mean the comb that i used to stick in my good 
tail but for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the licentiate told 
him to let her have it as there was now no further occasion for that stratagem because he 
might declare himself and appear in his own character and tell don quixote that he had 
fled to this inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him and should he ask for the 
princesss squire they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to give notice 
to the people of her kingdom that she was coming and bringing with her the deliverer of 
them all on this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady and at the same 
time they robbed her of that which is such a peculiar property of ladies of distinction 
that is to say the sweet fragrance that comes of being always among perfumes and flowers 
for i must tell thee sancho that when i approached to put dulcinea upon her hackney as thou 
sayest it was though to me it appeared a sheass she gave me a whiff of raw garlic that made 
my head reel and poisoned my very heart o scum of the earth cried sancho at this o miserable 
spiteful enchanters o that i could see you all strung by the gills like sardines on a twig 
ye know a great deal ye can do a great deal and ye do a great deal more it ought to have been 
enough for you ye scoundrels to have changed the pearls of my ladys eyes into oak galls 
and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red oxs tail and in short all her features 
from fair to foul without meddling with her smell for by that we might somehow have found 
out what was hidden underneath that ugly rind though to tell the truth i am more inclined 
to take him to be mad than sane with this don lorenzo went away to entertain don quixote 
as has been said and in the course of the conversation that passed between them don quixote 
said to don lorenzo your father senor don diego de miranda has told me of the rare abilities 
and subtle intellect you possess and above all that you are a great poet a poet it may be 
replied don lorenzo but a great one by no means it is true that i am somewhat given to poetry 
and to reading good poets but not so much so as to venture to make free in this fashion and 
not being prepared for the joke her astonishment was all the greater the duke had a mind 
to keep up the sport so he said it does not seem to me well done in you sir knight that after 
having received the hospitality that has been offered you in this very castle you should 
have ventured to carry off even three kerchiefs not to say my handmaids garters it shows 
a bad heart and does not tally with your reputation restore her garters or else i defy you 
to mortal combat for i am not afraid of rascally enchanters changing or altering my features 
as they changed his who encountered you into those of my lacquey tosilos god forbid said 
don quixote that i should draw my sword against your illustrious person from which i have 
received such great favours the kerchiefs i will restore as sancho says he has them as 
to the garters that is impossible for i have not got them neither has he and if your handmaiden 
here will look in her hidingplaces depend upon it she will find them i have never been a 
thief my lord duke nor do i mean to be so long as i live if god cease not to have me in his keeping 
this damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love for which i am not to blame and therefore 
need not ask pardon either of her or of your excellence whom i entreat to have a better opinion 
of me and once more to give me leave to pursue my journey and may god so prosper it senor don 
quixote said the duchess is nearly suppertime and the duke is is probably waiting come 
let us go to supper and retire to rest early for the journey you made yesterday from kandy 
was not such a short one but that it must have caused you some fatigue i feel none senora 
said don quixote for i would go so far as to swear to your excellence that in all my life i 
never mounted a quieter beast or a pleasanter paced one than clavileno and i dont know 
what could have induced malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so gentle and burn it 
so recklessly as he did probably said the duchess repenting of the evil he had done to the 
trifaldi and company and others and the crimes he must have committed as a wizard and enchanter 
he resolved to make away with all the instruments of his craft and so burned clavileno 
as the chief one and that which mainly kept him restless wandering from land to land and 
by its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great don quixote of la mancha 
sighed for her tobosos queen from side to side he traversed the grim sierra the champaign 
of aranjuez and montiels famous plain on rocinante oft a weary ride malignant planets 
cruel destiny pursued them both the fair manchegan dame and the unconquered star of chivalry 
nor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim of death he paid loves bitter penalty and 
left the marble to preserve his name caprichoso a most acute academician of argamasilla 
in praise of rocinante steed of don quixote of la mancha those who are coming this way are 
six troops of enchanters who are bringing on a triumphal car the peerless dulcinea del 
toboso she comes under enchantment together with the gallant frenchman montesinos 
to give instructions to don quixote as to how she the said lady may be disenchanted if you 
were the devil as you say and as your appearance indicates said the duke you would have 
known the said knight don quixote of la mancha who has for the lady of his heart a certain 
dulcinea del toboso he is the same senora replied sancho and that squire of his who figures 
or ought to figure in the said history under the name of sancho panza is myself unless they 
have changed me in the cradle i mean in the press i am rejoiced at all this said the duchess 
go brother panza and tell your master that he is welcome to my estate and that nothing could 
happen me that could give me greater pleasure sancho returned to his master mightily 
pleased with this gratifying answer and told him all the great lady had said to him lauding 
to the skies in his rustic phrase her rare beauty her graceful gaiety and her courtesy 
don quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle fixed himself in his stirrups settled 
his visor gave rocinante the spur and with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of 
the duchess who having sent to summon the duke her husband told him while don quixote was 
approaching all about the message and as both of them had read the first part of this history 
will remember well enough the gines de pasamonte whom with other galley slaves don quixote 
set free in the sierra morena a kindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse 
payment from that evilminded illconditioned set this gines de pasamontedon ginesillo 
de parapilla don quixote called himit was that stole dapple from sancho panza which because 
by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when was stated in the first part has 
been a puzzle to a good many people who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was 
the error of the press in fact however gines stole him while sancho panza was asleep on 
his back adopting the plan and device that brunello had recourse to when he stole sacripantes 
horse from between his legs at the siege of albracca and as has been told sancho afterwards 
recovered him this gines then afraid of being caught by the officers of justice who were 
looking for him to punish him for his numberless rascalities and offences which were 
so many and so great that he himself wrote a big book giving an account of them resolved 
to shift his quarters into the kingdom of aragon and cover up his left eye and take up the 
trade of a puppetshowman for this as well as juggling he knew how to practise to perfection 
from some released christians returning from barbary it so happened he bought the ape 
which he taught to mount upon his shoulder on his making a certain sign and to whisper or 
seem to do so in his ear thus prepared before entering any village whither he was bound 
with his show and his ape he used to inform himself at the nearest village or from the most 
likely person he could find as to what particular things had happened there and to whom 
and bearing them well in mind the first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had 
belonged to his greatgrandfather and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten 
with rust and covered with mildew he scoured and polished it as best he could but he perceived 
one great defect in it that it had no closed helmet nothing but a simple morion this deficiency 
however his ingenuity supplied for he contrived a kind of halfhelmet of pasteboard which 
fitted on to the morion looked like a whole one it is true that in order to see if it was strong 
and fit to stand a cut he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes the first of which 
undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do the ease with which he had knocked it to 
pieces disconcerted him somewhat and to guard against that danger he set to work again 
fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength and then not 
caring to try any more experiments with it he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the 
most perfect construction he next proceeded to inspect his hack which with more quartos 
than a real and more blemishes than the steed of gonela that tantum pellis et ossa fuit 
surpassed in his eyes the bucephalus of alexander or the babieca of the cid four days were 
spent in thinking what name to give him because as he said to himself it was not right that 
a horse belonging to a knight so famous and one with such merits of his own should be without 
some distinctive name and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before 
belonging to a knighterrant and what he then was for it was only reasonable that his master 
taking a new character he should take a new name and that it should be a distinguished and 
fullsounding one befitting the new order and calling he was about to follow and so after 
having composed struck out rejected added to unmade and remade a multitude of names out 
of his memory and fancy he decided upon calling him rocinante a name to his thinking lofty 
sonorous and significant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was the 
first and foremost of all the hacks in the world having got a name for his horse so much to 
his taste he was anxious to get one for himself and he was eight days more pondering over 
this point till at last he made up his mind to tell him that camilla stood as firm against 
gifts and promises as against words and that there was no use in taking any further trouble 
for the time was all spent to no purpose but chance directing things in a different manner 
so ordered it that anselmo having left lothario and camilla alone as on other occasions 
shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen through the keyhole 
to what passed between them and perceived that for more than half an hour lothario did 
not utter a word to camilla nor would utter a word though he were to be there for an age and 
he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be 
in love with for a knighterrant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit or 
a body without a soul as he said to himself if for my sins or by my good fortune i come across 
some giant hereabouts a common occurrence with knightserrant and overthrow him in one 
onslaught or cleave him asunder to the waist or in short vanquish and subdue him will it 
not be well to have some one i may send him to as a present that he may come in and fall on his 
knees before my sweet lady and in a humble submissive voice say i am the giant caraculiambro 
lord of the island of malindrania vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently 
extolled knight don quixote of la mancha at this instant don quixote began shouting out 
here here valiant knights here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms 
for they of the court are gaining the mastery in the tourney called away by this noise and 
outcry they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of the remaining books and so it is 
thought that the carolea the lion of spain and the deeds of the emperor written by don luis 
de avila went to the fire unseen and unheard for no doubt they were among those that remained 
and perhaps if the curate had seen them they would not have undergone so severe a sentence 
when they reached don quixote he was already out of bed and was still shouting and raving 
and slashing and cutting all round as wide awake as if he had never slept they closed with 
him and by force got him back to bed and when he had become a little calm addressing the curate 
he said to him of a truth senor archbishop turpin it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves 
the twelve peers so carelessly to allow the knights of the court to gain the victory in 
this tourney we the adventurers having carried off the honour on the three former days 
hush gossip said the curate please god the luck may turn and what is lost today may be won 
tomorrow for the present let your worship have a care of your health for it seems to me that 
you are overfatigued if not badly wounded wounded no said don quixote but bruised and 
battered no doubt for that bastard don roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak 
tree and all for envy because he sees that i alone rival him in his achievements but i should 
not call myself reinaldos of montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments 
as soon as i rise from this bed for the present let them bring me something to eat for that 
i feel is what will be more to my purpose and leave it to me to avenge myself they did as he 
wished they gave him something to eat and made him as comfortable as possible chapter 
lxxiv of how don quixote fell sick and of the will he made and how he died as nothing that 
is mans can last for ever but all tends ever downwards from its beginning to its end and 
above all mans life and as don quixotes enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to 
stay its course its end and close came when he least looked for it forwhether it was of the 
dejection the thought of his defeat produced or of heavens will that so ordered ita fever 
settled upon him and kept him in his bed for six days during which he was often visited by 
his friends the curate the bachelor and the barber while his good squire sancho panza 
never quitted his bedside they persuaded that it was grief at finding himself vanquished 
and the object of his heart the liberation and disenchantment of dulcinea unattained 
that kept him in this state strove by all the means in their power to divert him from such 
an unlucky scheme but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron nevertheless 
among many other representations made to him the housekeeper said to him in truth master 
mine if this that has happened to us today is to be called an adventure it has been one of 
the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in the whole course of our travels 
we have come out of it unbelaboured and undismayed neither have we drawn sword nor have 
we smitten the earth with our bodies nor have we been left famishing blessed be god that 
he has let me see such a thing with my own eyes thou sayest well sancho said don quixote let 
my armour be hung up for a trophy and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what was 
inscribed on the trophy of rolands armour these let none move who dareth not his might 
with roland prove although mine is of the cachopins of laredo said the traveller i will 
not venture to compare it with that of el toboso of la mancha a lineage that though modern 
may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the ages that 
are to come and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that zerbino placed 
at the foot of the trophy of orlandos arms saying these let none move who dareth not his 
might with roland prove although mine is of the cachopins of laredo said the traveller 
i will not venture to compare it with that of el toboso of la mancha a lineage that though 
modern may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the ages 
that are to come and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that zerbino placed 
at the foot of the trophy of orlandos arms saying these let none move who dareth not his 
might with roland prove thats the very thing said sancho and if it was not that we should 
feel the want of rocinante on the road it would be as well to see first of all what clavileno 
has in his stomach there is no occasion said the distressed one i will be bail for him and 
i know that malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about him you may mount without 
any fear senor don quixote on my head be it if it is wrong besides which you have been told 
that it is folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray i remember when i was a boy i brayed 
as often as i had a fancy without anyone hindering me and so elegantly and naturally that 
when i brayed all the asses in the town would bray but i was none the less for that the son 
of my parents who were greatly respected and though i was envied because of the gift by 
more than one of the high and mighty ones of the town i did not care two farthings for them 
he took off the mitre and seeing painted with devils he put it on again saying to himself 
well so far those dont burn me nor do these carry me off don quixote surveyed him too and 
though fear had got the better of his faculties he could not help smiling to see the figure 
sancho presented and now from underneath the catafalque so it seemed there rose a low 
sweet sound of flutes which coming unbroken by human voice for there silence itself kept 
silence had a soft and languishing effect then beside the pillow of what seemed to be the 
finest cloth of gold all bespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons which 
gave him an extremely gallant and splendid appearance above his helmet fluttered a great 
quantity of plumes green yellow and white and his lance which was leaning against a tree 
was very long and stout and had a steel point more than a palm in length don quixote observed 
all and took note of all and from what he saw and observed he concluded that the said knight 
must be a man of great strength but he did not for all that give way to fear like sancho panza 
on the contrary with a composed and dauntless air he said to the knight of the mirrors if 
sir knight your great eagerness to fight has not banished your courtesy by it i would entreat 
you to raise your visor a little in order that i may see if the comeliness of your countenance 
corresponds with that of your equipment whether you come victorious or vanquished out 
of this emprise sir knight replied he of the mirrors you will have more than enough time 
and leisure to see me and if now i do not comply with your request it is because it seems to 
me i should do a serious wrong to the fair casildea de vandalia in wasting time while i stopped 
to raise my visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware i maintain 
well then said don quixote while we are mounting you can at least tell me if i am that don 
quixote whom you said you vanquished to that we answer you said he of the mirrors that you 
are as like the very knight i vanquished as one egg is like another don quixote stopped 
to take breath and observing that silence was still preserved had a mind to continue his 
discourse and would have done so had not sancho interposed with his smartness for he seeing 
his master pause took the lead saying my lord don quixote of la mancha whose calling it 
is to give aid to the needy of all sorts and that being so it is not necessary for you senora 
to make any appeal to benevolence or deal in preambles only to tell your woes plainly and 
straightforwardly for you have hearers that will know how if not to remedy them to sympathise 
with them on hearing this the distressed duenna made as though she would throw herself 
at don quixotes feet and actually did fall before them and said as she strove to embrace 
them before these feet and legs i cast myself o unconquered knight as before what they 
are the foundations and pillars of knighterrantry these feet i desire to kiss for upon 
their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune o valorous errant whose 
veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse the fabulous ones of the amadises esplandians 
and belianises then turning from don quixote to sancho panza and grasping his hands she 
said o thou most loyal squire that ever served knighterrant in this present age or ages 
past whose goodness is more extensive than the beard of trifaldin my companion here of 
present well mayest thou boast thyself that in serving the great don quixote thou art 
serving summed up in one the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the world 
i conjure thee by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness that thou wilt become my kind 
intercessor with thy master that he speedily give aid to this most humble and most unfortunate 
countess to this sancho made answer as to my goodness senora being as long and as great 
as your squires beard it matters very little to me may i have my soul well bearded and moustached 
when it comes to quit this life thats the point about beards here below i care little or 
nothing but without all these blandishments and prayers i will beg my master for i know 
he loves me and besides he has need of me just now for a certain business to help and aid your 
worship as far as he can unpack your woes and lay them before us and leave us to deal with 
them for well be all of one mind the duke and duchess as it was they who had made the experiment 
of this adventure were ready to burst with laughter at all this and between themselves 
they commended the clever acting of the trifaldi who returning to her seat said queen 
dona maguncia reigned over the famous kingdom of kandy which lies between the great trapobana 
and the southern sea two leagues beyond cape comorin she was the widow of king archipiela 
her lord and husband and of their marriage they had issue the princess antonomasia heiress 
of the kingdom which princess antonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and 
direction i being the oldest and highest in rank of her mothers duennas time passed and 
the young antonomasia reached the age of fourteen and such a perfection of beauty that 
nature could not raise it higher then it must not be supposed her intelligence was childish 
she was as intelligent as she was fair and she was fairer than all the world and is so still 
unless the envious fates and hardhearted sisters three have cut for her the thread of 
life but that they have not for heaven will not suffer so great a wrong to earth as it would 
be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface of this beauty to which 
my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice countless princes not only of that country 
but of others were enamoured and among them a private gentleman who was at the court dared 
to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty trusting to his youth his gallant 
bearing his numerous accomplishments and graces and his quickness and readiness of 
wit for i may tell your highnesses if i am not wearying you that he played the guitar so as 
to make it speak and above all handles a sword as well as the best for that excellence alone 
said don quixote at this the youth deserves to marry not merely the fair quiteria but queen 
guinevere herself were she alive now in spite of launcelot and all who would try to prevent 
it say that to my wife said sancho who had until now listened in silence for she wont hear 
of anything but each one marrying his equal holding with the proverb each ewe to her like 
what i would like is that this good basilio for i am beginning to take a fancy to him already 
should marry this lady quiteria and a blessing and good lucki meant to say the oppositeon 
people who would prevent those who love one another from marrying if all those who love 
one another were to marry said don quixote it would deprive parents of the right to choose 
and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time and if it was left to 
daughters to choose husbands as they pleased one would be for choosing her fathers servant 
and another some one she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing 
though he may be a drunken bully for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment 
so much wanted in choosing ones way of life and the matrimonial choice is very liable to 
error and it needs great caution and the special favour of heaven to make it a good one he 
who has to make a long journey will if he is wise look out for some trusty and pleasant companion 
to accompany him before he sets out why then should not he do the same who has to make the 
whole journey of life down to the final haltingplace of death more especially when the 
companion has to be his companion in bed at board and everywhere as the wife is to her husband 
the companionship of ones wife is no article of merchandise that after it has been bought 
may be returned or bartered or changed for it is an inseparable accident that lasts as 
long as life lasts it is a noose that once you put it round your neck turns into a gordian 
knot which if the scythe of death does not cut it there is no untying i could say a great deal 
more on this subject were i not prevented by the anxiety i feel to know if the senor licentiate 
has anything more to tell about the story of basilio to this the student bachelor or as 
don quixote called him licentiate replied i have nothing whatever to say further but 
that from the moment basilio learned that the fair quiteria was to be married to camacho 
the rich he has never been seen to smile or heard to utter rational word and he always goes 
about moody and dejected talking to himself in a way that would have touched a heart of 
marble not to say that of the ass which always followed him wherever he led lovingly and 
sociably nevertheless they returned to the high road and pursued it at a venture without 
any other aim as they went along then in this way sancho said to his master senor what a fool 
i should have looked if i had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first adventure your 
worship achieved instead of the foals of the three mares after all a sparrow in the hand 
is better than a vulture on the wing at the same time sancho replied don quixote if thou 
hadst let me attack them as i wanted at the very least the emperors gold crown and cupids 
painted wings would have fallen to thee as spoils for i should have taken them by force 
and given them into thy hands the sceptres and crowns of those playactor emperors said 
sancho were never yet pure gold but only brass foil or tin that is true said don quixote 
and taking a handkerchief out of his pocket he begged the distressed one to bandage his 
eyes very carefully but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again saying if 
my memory does not deceive me i have read in virgil of the palladium of troy a wooden horse 
the greeks offered to the goddess pallas which was big with armed knights who were afterwards 
the destruction of troy so it would be as well to see first of all what clavileno has in his 
stomach there is no occasion said the distressed one i will be bail for him and i know that 
malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about him you may mount without any fear 
senor don quixote on my head be it if any harm befalls you don quixote thought that to say 
anything further with regard to his safety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable 
light and so without more words he mounted clavileno and tried the peg which turned easily 
and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down he looked like nothing so much as a figure 
in some roman triumph painted or embroidered on a flemish tapestry much against the grain 
and very slowly sancho proceeded to mount and after settling himself as well as he could 
on the croup found it rather hard and not at all soft and asked the duke if it would be possible 
to find cardenio as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story the goatherd 
told him as he had told him before that there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair 
was but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in 
with him either in or out of his senses chapter xxv which treats of the strange things that 
happened to the stout knight of la mancha in the sierra morena and of his imitation of the 
penance of beltenebros don quixote took leave of the goatherd and once more mounting 
rocinante bade sancho follow him which he having no ass did very discontentedly they 
proceeded slowly making their way into the most rugged part of the mountain sancho all 
the while dying to have a talk with his master and longing for him to begin so that there 
should be no breach of the injunction laid upon him but unable to keep silence so long he 
said to him senor don quixote give me your worships blessing and dismissal for id like 
to go home at once to my wife and children with whom i can at any rate talk and converse as 
much as i like for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and not speak to 
you when i have a mind is burying me alive if luck would have it that animals spoke as they 
did in the days of guisopete it would not be so bad because i could talk to rocinante about 
whatever came into my head and so put up with my illfortune but it is a hard case and not to 
be borne with patience to go seeking adventures all ones life and get nothing but kicks 
and blanketings brickbats and punches and with all this to have to sew up ones mouth without 
daring to say what is in ones heart just as if one were dumb i understand thee sancho replied 
don quixote thou art dying to have the interdict i placed upon thy tongue removed consider 
it removed and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains so be it said 
sancho let me speak now for god knows what will happen byandby and to take advantage of 
the permit at once i ask what made your worship stand up so for that queen majimasa or whatever 
her name is or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not for if your 
worship had let that passand you were not a judge in the matterit is my belief the madman 
would have gone on with his story and the blow of the stone and the kicks and more than half 
a dozen cuffs would have been escaped in faith sancho answered don quixote if thou knewest 
as i do what an honourable and illustrious lady queen madasima was i know thou wouldst 
say i had great patience that i did not break in pieces the mouth that uttered such blasphemies 
for a very great blasphemy it is to say or imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon 
the truth of the story is that that master elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man 
of great prudence and sound judgment and served as governor and physician to the queen 
but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving very severe punishment 
and as a proof that cardenio did not know what he was saying remember when he said it he was 
out of his wits that is what i say said sancho there was no occasion for minding the words 
of a madman for if good luck had not helped your worship and he had sent that stone at your 
head instead of at your breast a fine way we should have been in for standing up for my lady 
yonder god confound her and then would not cardenio have gone free as a madman against 
men in their senses or against madmen said don quixote every knighterrant is bound to 
stand up for the honour of women whoever they may be much more for queens of such high degree 
and dignity as queen madasima for whom i have a particular regard on account of her amiable 
qualities for besides being extremely beautiful she was very wise and very patient under 
her misfortunes of which she had many and the counsel and society of the master elisabad 
were a great help and support to her in enduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation 
hence the ignorant and illdisposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was 
his mistress and they lie i say it once more and will lie two hundred times more all who think 
and say so i neither say nor think so said sancho let them look to it with their bread let 
them eat it they have rendered account to god whether they misbehaved or not i come from 
my vineyard i know nothing i am not fond of prying into other mens lives he who buys and lies 
feels it in his purse moreover naked was i born naked i find myself i neither lose nor gain 
nay while i see myself put into a book and passed on from hand to hand over the world i dont 
care a fig let them say what they like naked was i born naked i find myself i neither lose 
nor gain nay while i see myself put into a book and passed on from hand to hand over the world 
i dont care a fig let them say what they like of me that sancho returned don quixote reminds 
me of what happened to a famous poet of our own day who having written a bitter satire against 
all the courtesan ladies did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable 
whether she was one or not she seeing she was not in the list of the poet asked him what he 
had seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others telling him he must 
add to his satire and put her in the new part or else look out for the consequences the poet 
did as she bade him and left her without a shred of reputation and she was satisfied by getting 
fame though it was infamy in keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who 
set fire to the famous temple of diana by repute one of the seven wonders of the world and 
burned it with the sole object of making his name live in after ages and though it was forbidden 
to name him or mention his name by word of mouth or in writing lest the object of his ambition 
should be attained nevertheless it became known that he was called erostratus and something 
of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great emperor charles v and a gentleman 
in rome the emperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the rotunda called in ancient 
times the temple of all the gods but nowadays by a better nomenclature of all the saints 
which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan construction in rome and the 
one which best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its founders 
it is in the form of a half orange of enormous dimensions and well lighted though no light 
penetrates it save that which is admitted by a window or rather round skylight at the top 
and it was from this that the emperor examined the building a roman gentleman stood by 
his side and explained to him the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric 
and its wonderful architecture and when they had left the skylight he said to the emperor 
a thousand times your sacred majesty the impulse came upon me to seize your majesty in 
my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight so as to leave behind me in the world 
a name that would last for ever i am thankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought 
into effect said the emperor and i shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting 
your loyalty to the test and i therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to be where i am 
and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him my meaning is sancho 
that the desire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive what thinkest thou was it that 
flung horatius in full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the tiber what burned 
the hand and arm of mutius what impelled curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that 
opened in the midst of rome what in opposition to all the omens that declared against him 
made julius caesar cross the rubicon and to come to more modern examples what scuttled 
the ships and left stranded and cut off the gallant spaniards under the command of the 
most courteous cortes in the new world all these and a variety of other great exploits 
are were and will be the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and a portion of the 
immortality their famous deeds deserve though we catholic christians and knightserrant 
look more to that future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than 
to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this present transitory life a fame that 
however long it may last must after all end with the world itself which has its own appointed 
end so that o sancho in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the christian religion 
we profess has assigned to us we have to slay pride in giants envy by generosity and nobleness 
of heart anger by calmness of demeanour and equanimity gluttony and sloth by the spareness 
of our diet and the length of our vigils lust and lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to 
those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts indolence by traversing the world 
in all directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves besides christians famous 
knights such sancho are the means by which we reach those extremes of praise that fair 
fame carries with it all that your worship has said is quite true answered the lad but the 
end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship supposes how the 
opposite said don quixote did not the clown pay thee then not only did he not pay me replied 
the lad but as soon as your worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone he tied me 
up again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging that left me like a flayed saint bartholomew 
and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some jest or gibe about having made a fool 
of your worship and but for the pain i was suffering i should have laughed at the things 
he said in short he left me in such a condition that i have been until now in a hospital getting 
cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on me then for all which your 
worship is to blame for if you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for 
you nor meddled in other peoples affairs my master would have been content with giving 
me one or two dozen lashes and would have then loosed me and paid me what he owed me but when 
your worship abused him so out of measure and gave him so many hard words his anger was kindled 
and as he could not revenge himself on you as soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst 
upon me in such a way that what is said of me gives no offence for on the faith of a true squire 
if he had said anything about me that was at all unbecoming an old christian such as i am 
the deaf would have heard of it that would be working miracles said samson miracles or 
no miracles said sancho let everyone mind how he speaks or writes about people and not 
set down at random the first thing that comes into his head one of the faults they find with 
this history said the bachelor is that its author inserted in it a novel called the illadvised 
curiosity not that it is bad or illtold but that it is out of place and has nothing to do with 
the history of his worship senor don quixote i will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages 
and the baskets said sancho then i say said don quixote the author of our history will be 
some sage enchanter for to such nothing that they choose to write about is hidden what 
said sancho a sage and an enchanter why the bachelor samson carrasco that is the name of 
him i spoke of says the author of the history is called cide hamete berengena that is a moorish 
name said don quixote may be so replied the lad god be with you for here comes the daylight 
and without waiting for any more of his questions he whipped on his mules sancho seeing 
his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied said to him senor daylight will be here 
before long and it will not do for us to uncover ourselves for he who has us in charge will 
be responsible for us and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable 
us to descend at one swoop on the kingdom of kandy as the saker or falcon does on the heron 
so as to seize it however high it may soar and though it seems to us not half an hour since 
we left the garden believe me we must have travelled a great distance i dont know how that 
may be said sancho all i know is that if the senora magallanes or magalona was satisfied 
with this croup she could not have been very tender of flesh the duke the duchess and all 
in the garden were listening to the conversation of the two heroes and were beyond measure 
amused by it and now desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and wellcontrived 
adventure they applied a light to clavilenos tail with some tow and the horse being full 
of squibs and crackers immediately blew up with a prodigious noise and brought don quixote 
and sancho panza to the ground half singed by this time the bearded band of duennas the 
trifaldi and all had vanished from the garden and those that remained lay stretched on 
the ground as if in a swoon don quixote and sancho got up rather shaken and looking about 
them were filled with amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which they 
had started and seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground and their astonishment 
was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance planted in the 
ground and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which 
there was the following inscription in large gold letters the illustrious knight don 
quixote of la mancha who rights wrongs gives food to those who thirst and drink to the hungry 
thats all very well but do you know her house sancho my master says it will be some royal 
palace or grand castle and have you ever seen her by any chance neither i nor my master ever 
saw her and does it strike you that it would be just and right if the el toboso people finding 
out that you were here with the intention of going to tamper with their princesses and 
trouble their ladies were to come and cudgel your ribs and not leave a whole bone in you 
they would indeed have very good reason if they did not see that i am under orders and that 
you are a messenger my friend no blame belongs to you dont you trust to that sancho for the 
manchegan folk are as hottempered as they are honest and wont put up with liberties from 
anybody by the lord if they get scent of you it will be worse for you i promise you be off you 
scoundrel let the bolt fall why should i go looking for three feet on a cat tis you that are 
the cat rat and rascal replied don quixote and acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly 
that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground and had it not 
been that dorothea cried out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on 
the spot do you think he said to him after a pause you scurvy clown that you are to be always 
interfering with me and that you are to be always interfering with me and that you are to 
be always interfering with me and that you are to be always offending and i always pardoning 
dont fancy it impious scoundrel for that beyond a doubt thou art since thou hast set thy 
tongue going against the peerless dulcinea know you not lout vagabond beggar that were 
it not for the might that she infuses into my arm i should not have strength enough to kill 
a flea say scoffer with a vipers tongue what think you has won this kingdom and cut off this 
giants head and made you a marquis for all this i count as already accomplished and decided 
but the might of dulcinea employing my arm as the instrument of her achievements she fights 
in me and conquers in me and i live and breathe in her and owe my life and being to her o whoreson 
scoundrel how ungrateful you are you see yourself raised from the dust of the earth to 
be a titled lord and the return you make for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who 
has conferred it upon you sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said 
and rising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind dorotheas palfrey 
and from that position he said to his master tell me senor if your worship is resolved not 
to marry this great princess it is plain the kingdom will not be yours and not being so how 
can you bestow favours upon me that is what i complain of let your worship at any rate marry 
this queen now that we have got her here as if showered down from heaven and afterwards 
you may go back to my lady dulcinea for there must have been kings in the world who kept mistresses 
as to beauty i have nothing to do with it and if the truth is to be told i like them both though 
i have never seen the lady dulcinea how never seen her blasphemous traitor exclaimed 
don quixote hast thou not just now brought me a message from her i mean said sancho that 
i did not see her so much at my leisure that i could take particular notice of her beauty 
or of her charms piecemeal but taken in the lump i like her now i forgive thee said don quixote 
and do thou forgive me the injury i have done thee for our first impulses are not in our control 
that i see replied sancho and with me the wish to speak is always the first impulse and i 
cannot help saying once at any rate what i have on the tip of my tongue that i dont want to 
be spoiled say on sancho said don quixote and be brief in thy discourse for there is no pleasure 
in one that is long well then senor returned sancho i say that for some days past i have been 
considering how little is got or gained by going in search of these adventures that your 
worship seeks in these wilds and crossroads where even if the most perilous are victoriously 
achieved there is no one to see or know of them and so they must be left untold for ever to 
the loss of your worships object and the credit they deserve therefore it seems to me it 
would be better saving your worships better judgment if we were to go and serve some emperor 
or other great prince who may have some war on hand in whose service your worship may prove 
the worth of your person your great might and greater understanding on perceiving which 
the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us each according to his 
merits and there you will not be at a loss for a reply after a long pause however he said to 
him you were right when you saw curiosity in my amazement sir knight but you have not succeeded 
in removing the astonishment i feel at seeing you for although you say senor that knowing 
who you are ought to remove it it has not done so on the contrary now that i know i am left more 
amazed and astonished than before what is it possible that there are knightserrant in 
the world in these days and histories of real chivalry printed i cannot realise the fact 
that there can be anyone on earth nowadays who aids widows or protects maidens or defends 
wives or succours orphans nor should i believe it had i not seen it in your worship with 
my own eyes blessed be heaven for by means of this history of your noble and genuine chivalrous 
deeds which you say has been printed the countless stories of fictitious knightserrant 
with which the world is filled so much to the injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit 
of good histories will have been driven into oblivion there is a good deal to be said on 
that point said don quixote as to whether the histories of the knightserrant are fiction 
or not why is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false said the man in green 
i doubt it said don quixote but never mind that just now if our journey lasts long enough 
i trust in god i shall show your worship that you do wrong in going with the stream of those 
who regard it as a matter of certainty that they are not true from this last observation 
of don quixotes the traveller began to have a suspicion that he was some crazy being and 
was waiting him to confirm it by something further but before they could turn to any new 
subject don quixote begged him to tell him who he was since he himself had rendered account 
of his station and life to this he in the green gaban replied i sir knight of the rueful countenance 
that i had undergone any change or transformation did not tell you the truth for i am the 
same as i was yesterday it is true that certain strokes of good fortune that have given 
me more than i could have hoped for have made some alteration in me but i have not therefore 
ceased to be what i was before or to entertain the same desire i have had all through of availing 
myself of the might of your valiant and invincible arm and so senor let your goodness reinstate 
the father that begot me in your good opinion and be assured that he was a wise and prudent 
man since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of remedying my misfortune for 
i believe senor that had it not been for you i should never have lit upon the good fortune 
i now possess and in this i am saying what is perfectly true as most of these gentlemen who 
are present can fully testify all that remains is to set out on our journey tomorrow for 
today we could not make much way and for the rest of the happy result i am looking forward 
to i trust to god and the valour of your heart so said the sprightly dorothea and on hearing 
her don quixote turned to sancho and said to him with an angry air i declare now little sancho 
thou art the greatest little villain in spain say thief and vagabond hast thou not just 
now told me that this princess had been turned into a maiden called dorothea and that the 
head which i am persuaded i cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee and other nonsense 
that put me in the greatest perplexity i have ever been in all my life i vow and here he looked 
to heaven and ground his teeth i have a mind to play the mischief with thee in a way that will 
teach sense for the future to all lying squires of knightserrant in the world let your 
worship be calm senor returned sancho for it may well be that i have been mistaken as to 
the change of the lady princess micomicona but as to the giants head or at least as to the 
piercing of the wineskins and the blood being red wine i make no mistake as sure as there 
is a god because the wounded skins are there at the head of your worships bed and the wine 
has made a lake of the room if not you will see when the eggs come to be fried i mean when his 
worship the landlord calls for all the damages for the rest i am heartily glad that her 
ladyship the queen is as she was for it concerns me as much as anyone i tell thee again sancho 
thou art a fool said don quixote forgive me and that will do that will do said don fernando 
let us say no more about it and as her ladyship the princess proposes to set out tomorrow 
because it is too late today so be it and we will pass the night in pleasant conversation 
and tomorrow we will all accompany senor don quixote for we wish to witness the valiant 
and unparalleled achievements he is about to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise 
which he has undertaken it is i who shall wait upon and accompany you said don quixote and 
i am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me and the good opinion entertained 
of me which i shall strive to justify or it shall cost me my life or even more if it can possibly 
cost me more many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed between 
don quixote and don fernando but they were brought to an end by a traveller who at this moment 
entered the inn and who seemed from his attire to be a christian lately come from the country 
of the moors for he was dressed in a shortskirted coat of blue cloth with halfsleeves and 
without a collar his breeches were also of blue cloth and his cap of the same colour and 
he wore yellow buskins and had a moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast 
behind him mounted upon an ass there came a woman dressed in moorish fashion with her face 
veiled and a scarf on her head and wearing a little brocaded cap and a mantle that covered 
her from her shoulders to her feet the man was of a robust and wellproportioned frame in 
age a little over forty rather swarthy in complexion with long moustaches and a full beard 
and in short his appearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have been 
taken for a person of quality and good birth on entering he asked for a room and when they 
told him there was none in the inn and the seat of honour at the head of it though he was for 
refusing it they assigned to don quixote who desired the lady micomicona to place herself 
by his side as he was her protector luscinda and zoraida took their places next her opposite 
to them were don fernando and cardenio and next the captive and the other gentlemen and 
by the side of the ladies the curate and the barber and so they supped in high enjoyment 
which was increased when they observed don quixote leave off eating and moved by an impulse 
like that which made him deliver himself at such length when he supped with the goatherds 
begin to address them verily gentlemen if we reflect upon it great and marvellous are 
the things they see who make profession of the order of knighterrantry say what being 
is there in this world who entering the gate of this castle at this moment and seeing us 
as we are here would suppose or imagine us to be what we are who would say that this lady who 
is beside me was the great queen that we all know her to be or that i am that knight of the rueful 
countenance trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of fame now there can be no doubt that this 
art and calling surpasses all those that mankind has invented and is the more deserving 
of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril away with those 
who assert that letters have the preeminence over arms i will tell them whosoever they 
may be that they know not what they say for the reason which such persons commonly assign 
and upon which they chiefly rest is that the labours of the mind are greater than those 
of the body and that arms give employment to the body alone as if the calling were a porters 
trade for which nothing more is required than sturdy strength or as if in what we who profess 
them call arms there were not included acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence 
is requisite or as if the soul of the warrior when he has an army or the defence of a city under 
his care did not exert itself as much by mind as by body nay see whether by bodily strength 
it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy his plans stratagems or obstacles 
or to ward off impending mischief for all these are the work of the mind and in them the body 
has no share whatever since therefore arms have need of the mind as much as letters let 
us see now which of the two minds that of the man of letters or that of the warrior has most 
to do and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain for that purpose 
is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object the end and goal of lettersi 
am not speaking now of divine letters the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to 
heaven for with an end so infinite no other can be comparedi speak of human letters the 
end of which is to establish distributive justice give to every man that which is his and 
see and take care that good laws are observed an end undoubtedly noble lofty and deserving 
of high praise but not such as should be given to that sought by arms which have for their 
end and object peace the greatest boon that men can desire in this life the first good news 
the world and mankind received was that which the angels announced on the night that was 
our day when they sang in the air glory to god in the highest and peace on earth to men of goodwill 
and the salutation which the great master of heaven and earth taught his disciples and 
chosen followers when they entered any house was to say peace be on this house and many 
other times he said to them my peace i give unto you my peace i leave you peace be with you 
a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand a jewel without which there can 
be no happiness either on earth or in heaven this peace is the true end of war and war is only 
another name for arms this then being admitted that the end of war is peace and that so far 
it has the advantage of the end of letters let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of 
letters and those of him who follows the profession of arms and see which are the greater 
don quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such correct language that 
for the time being he made it impossible for any of his hearers to consider him a madman 
on the contrary as they were mostly gentlemen to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth 
they listened to him with great pleasure as he continued here then i say is what the student 
has to undergo first of all poverty not that all are poor but to put the case as strongly 
as possible and when i have said that he endures poverty i think nothing more need be said 
about his hard fortune for he who is poor has no share of the good things of life this poverty 
he suffers from in various ways hunger or cold or nakedness or all together but for all 
that it is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of senor don quixote who is of 
course the cream of good breeding and flower of ceremonyor cirimony as you would say yourself 
fair be the fortunes of such a master and such a servant the one the cynosure of knighterrantry 
the other the star of squirely fidelity rise sancho my friend i will repay your courtesy 
by taking care that my lord the duke makes good to you the promised gift of the government 
as soon as possible with this the conversation came to an end and don quixote retired to 
take his midday sleep but the duchess begged sancho unless he had a very great desire to 
go to sleep to come and spend the afternoon with her and her damsels in a very cool chamber 
sancho replied that though he certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in 
the heat of the day in summer to serve her excellence he would try with all his might not 
to sleep even one that day and that he would come in obedience to her command and with that 
he went off the duke gave fresh orders with respect to treating don quixote as a knighterrant 
without departing even in smallest particular from the style in which as the stories 
tell us they used to treat the knights of old chapter xxxiii of the delectable discourse 
which the duchess and her damsels held with sancho panza well worth reading and noting 
chapter xxxiv which relates how they learned the way in which they were to disenchant 
the peerless dulcinea del toboso which is one of the rarest adventures in this book great 
was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of don quixote and sancho 
panza and they could not make out what it was the widespread grunting drove came on in a 
surging mass and without showing any respect for don quixotes dignity or sanchos passed 
right over the pair of them demolishing sanchos entrenchments and not only upsetting 
don quixote but sweeping rocinante off his feet into the bargain and what with the trampling 
and the grunting and the pace at which the unclean beasts went packsaddle armour dapple 
and rocinante were left scattered on the ground and sancho and don quixote at their wits 
end sancho got up as well as he could grappled with maritornes and he and she between them 
began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world the carrier however perceiving 
by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared with his ladylove quitting don quixote 
ran to bring her the help she needed and the innkeeper did the same but with a different 
intention for his was to chastise the lass as he believed that beyond a doubt she alone 
was the cause of all the harmony and so as the saying is cat to rat rat to rope rope to stick 
the carrier pounded sancho sancho the lass she him and the innkeeper her and all worked 
away so briskly that they did not give themselves a moments rest and the best of it was his 
eyes were not open for he was fast asleep and dreaming that he was doing battle with the 
giant for his imagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he was going to accomplish 
that it made him dream he had already reached the kingdom of micomicon and was engaged 
in combat with his enemy and believing he was laying on the giant he had given so many sword 
cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of wine on seeing this the landlord was so 
enraged that he fell on don quixote and with his clenched fist began to pummel him in such 
a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet and then mounting upon him 
crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction the goatherd who came to the rescue shared the 
same fate and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to 
his hidingplace on the mountain sancho rose and with the rage he felt at finding himself 
so belaboured without deserving it ran to take vengeance on the goatherd accusing him 
of not giving them warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit for if they had 
known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves the goatherd replied 
that he had said so and that if he had not heard him that was no fault of his sancho retorted 
and the goatherd rejoined and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the 
beard and exchanging such fisticuffs that if don quixote had not made peace between them 
they would have knocked one another to pieces leave me alone sir knight of the rueful countenance 
said sancho grappling with the goatherd for of this fellow who is a clown like myself and 
no dubbed knight i can safely take satisfaction for the affront he has offered me fighting 
with him hand to hand like an honest man that is true said don quixote and andres must have 
patience until my return as you say senora but i once more swear and promise not to stop 
until i have seen him avenged and paid i have no faith in those oaths said andres i would 
rather have now something to help me to get to seville than all the revenges in the world 
if you have here anything to eat that i can take with me give it me and god be with your worship 
and all knightserrant and may their errands turn out as well for themselves as they have 
for me sancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese and giving them 
to the lad he said here take this brother andres for we have all of us a share in your misfortune 
why what share have you got this share of bread and cheese i am giving you answered sancho 
and god knows whether i shall feel the want of it myself or not for i would have you know senor 
all is not gold that glitters and that same little altisidora has more forwardness than 
good looks and more impudence than modesty besides being not very sound for she has such 
a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be near her for a moment and even my lady the 
duchessbut ill hold my tongue for they say that walls have ears for heavens sake dona rodriguez 
what ails my lady the duchess asked don quixote adjured in that way replied the duenna 
i cannot help answering the question and telling the whole truth senor don quixote have 
you observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess that smooth complexion of hers like 
a burnished polished sword those two cheeks of milk and carmine that gay lively step with 
which she treads or rather seems to spurn the earth so that one would fancy she went radiating 
health wherever she passed well then let me tell you she may thank first of all god for this 
and next two issues that she has one in each leg by which all the evil humours of which the 
doctors say she is full are discharged blessed virgin exclaimed don quixote and is it 
possible that my lady the duchess has drains of that sort i would not have believed it either 
for in this village everybody thinks my husband a numskull and except for governing a 
flock of goats they cannot fancy what sort of government he can be fit for god grant it and 
direct him according as he sees his children stand in need of it i am resolved with your 
worships leave lady of my soul to make the most of this fair day and go to court to stretch 
myself at ease in a coach and make all those i have envying me already burst their eyes out 
so i beg your excellence to order my husband to send me a small trifle of money and to let 
it be something to speak of because ones expenses are heavy at the court for a loaf costs 
a real and meat thirty maravedis a pound which is beyond everything and if he does not want 
me to go let him tell me in time for my feet are on the fidgets to be off and my friends and neighbours 
tell me that if my daughter and i make a figure and a brave show at court my husband will come 
to be known far more by me than i by him for of course plenty of people will ask who are those 
ladies in that coach and some servant of mine will answer the wife and daughter of sancho 
panza governor of the island of barataria squire that was to the famous knight don quixote 
of la mancha otherwise called the knight of the rueful countenance and it will be no great 
matter if it is in some other persons hand for as well as i recollect thou saidst that her 
eyes were pearls but eyes that are like pearls are rather the eyes of a seabream than of 
a lady and i am persuaded that dulcineas must be green emeralds full and soft with two rainbows 
for eyebrows take away those pearls from her eyes and transfer them to her teeth for beyond 
a doubt sancho thou hast taken the one for the other the eyes for the teeth very likely said 
sancho for her beauty bewildered me as much as her ugliness did your worship but let us 
leave it all to god who alone knows what is to happen in this vale of tears in this evil world 
of ours where there is hardly a thing to be found without some mixture of wickedness roguery 
and rascality but one thing senor troubles me more than all the rest and that is thinking 
what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant or some other knight and orders 
him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady dulcinea del toboso as it seems 
contrary to what i thought that she is beautiful after all it must be a condition too that 
i am not to be called upon to do anything except what concerns keeping him clean and comfortable 
in this i will dance attendance on him readily but to expect me to draw sword even against 
rascally churls of the hatchet and hood is idle i dont set up to be a fighting man senor samson 
but only the best and most loyal squire that ever served knighterrant in this present 
age or ages past whose goodness is more extensive than the beard of trifaldin my companion 
here of present well mayest thou boast thyself that in serving the great don quixote thou 
art serving summed up in one the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the world 
i conjure thee by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness that thou wilt become my kind 
intercessor with thy master that he speedily give aid to this most humble and most unfortunate 
countess to this sancho made answer as to my goodness senora being as long and as great 
as your squires beard it matters very little to me may i have my soul well bearded and moustached 
when it comes to quit this life thats the point about beards here below i care little or 
nothing but without all these blandishments and prayers i will beg my master for i know 
he loves me and besides he has need of me just now for a certain business to help and aid your 
worship as far as he can unpack your woes and lay them before us and leave us to deal with 
them for well be all of one mind the duke and duchess as it was they who had made the experiment 
of this adventure were ready to burst with laughter at all this and between themselves 
they commended the clever acting of the trifaldi who returning to her seat said queen 
dona maguncia reigned over the famous kingdom of kandy which lies between the great trapobana 
and the southern sea two leagues beyond cape comorin she was the widow of king archipiela 
her lord and husband and of their marriage they had issue the princess antonomasia heiress 
of the kingdom which princess antonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and 
direction i being the oldest and highest in rank of her mothers duennas time passed and 
the young antonomasia reached the age of fourteen and such a perfection of beauty that 
nature could not raise it higher then it must not be supposed her intelligence was childish 
she was as intelligent as she was fair and she was fairer than all the world and is so still 
unless the envious fates and hardhearted sisters three have cut for her the thread of 
life but that they have not for heaven will not suffer so great a wrong to earth as it would 
be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface of this beauty to which 
my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice countless princes not only of that country 
but of others were enamoured and among them a private gentleman who was at the court dared 
to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty trusting to his youth his gallant 
bearing his numerous accomplishments and graces and his quickness and readiness of 
wit for i may tell your highnesses if i am not wearying you that he played the guitar so as 
to make it speak and he was besides a poet and a great dancer and he could make birdcages 
so well that by making them alone he might have gained a livelihood had he found himself 
reduced to utter poverty and gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a mountain 
not to say a tender young girl but all his gallantry wit and gaiety all his graces and accomplishments 
would have been of little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil had not the 
impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first first the villain and heartless 
vagabond sought to win my goodwill and purchase my compliance so as to get me like a treacherous 
warder to deliver up to him the keys of the fortress i had in charge in a word he gained an 
influence over my mind and overcame my resolutions with i know not what trinkets and jewels 
he gave me but it was some verses i heard him singing one night from a grating that opened 
on the street where he lived that more than anything else made me give way and led to my fall 
and if i remember rightly they ran thus from that sweet enemy of mine my bleeding heart 
hath had its wound and to increase the pain im bound to suffer and to make no sign the lines 
seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup and afterwards i may say ever since then 
looking at the misfortune into which i have fallen i have thought that poets as plato advised 
ought to be banished from all wellordered states at least the amatory ones for they write 
verses not like those of the marquis of mantua that delight and draw tears from the women 
and children but sharppointed conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns and like 
the lightning strike it leaving the raiment uninjured another time he sang come death 
so subtly veiled that i thy coming know not how or when lest it should give me life again 
to find how sweet it is to die and other verses and burdens of the same sort such as enchant 
when sung and fascinate when written and then when they condescend to compose a sort of 
verse that was at that time in vogue in kandy which they call seguidillas then it is that 
hearts leap and laughter breaks forth and the body grows restless and all the senses turn 
quicksilver and so i say sirs that these troubadours richly deserve to be banished to 
the isles of the lizards though it is not they that are in fault but the simpletons that 
extol them and the fools that believe in them and had i been the faithful duenna i should 
have been his stale conceits would have never moved me nor should i have been taken in by 
such phrases as in death i live in ice i burn in flames i shiver hopeless i hope i go and stay 
and paradoxes of that sort which their writings are full of and then when they promise 
the phoenix of arabia the crown of ariadne the horses of the sun the pearls of the south 
the gold of tibar and the balsam of panchaia then it is they give a loose to their pens for 
it costs them little to make promises they have no intention or power of fulfilling but 
where am i wandering to woe is me unfortunate being what madness or folly leads me to speak 
of the faults of others when there is so much to be said about my own again woe is me hapless 
that i am it was not verses that conquered me but my own simplicity it was not music made 
me yield but my own imprudence my own great ignorance and little caution opened the way 
and cleared the path for don clavijos advances for that was the name of the gentleman i 
have referred to and so with my help as gobetween he found his way many a time into the chamber 
of the deceived antonomasia deceived not by him but by me under the title of a lawful husband 
for sinner though i was would not have allowed him to approach the edge of her shoesole 
without being her husband no no not that marriage must come first in any business of this 
sort that i take in hand but there was one hitch in this case which was that of inequality 
of rank don clavijo being a private gentleman and the princess antonomasia as i said heiress 
to the kingdom the entanglement remained for some time a secret kept hidden by my cunning 
precautions until i perceived that a certain expansion of waist in antonomasia must 
before long disclose it the dread of which made us all there take counsel together and 
it was agreed that before the mischief came to light don clavijo should demand antonomasia 
as his wife before the vicar in virtue of an agreement to marry him made by the princess 
and drafted by my wit in such binding terms that the might of samson could not have broken 
it the necessary steps were taken the vicar saw the agreement and took the ladys confession 
she confessed everything in full and he ordered her into the custody of a very worthy alguacil 
of the court are there alguacils of the court in kandy too said sancho at this and poets 
and seguidillas i swear i think the world is the same all over but make haste senora trifaldi 
for it is late and i am dying to know the end of this long story i will replied the countess 
chapter xxxix in which the trifaldi continues her marvellous and memorable story by 
every word that sancho uttered the duchess was as much delighted as don quixote was driven 
to desperation he bade him hold his tongue and the distressed one went on to say at length 
after much questioning and answering as the princess held to her story without changing 
or varying her previous declaration the vicar gave his decision in favour of don clavijo 
and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife which the queen dona maguncia the princess 
antonomasias mother so took to heart that within the space of three days we buried her 
she died no doubt said sancho of course said trifaldin they dont bury living people in 
kandy only the dead senor squire said sancho a man in a swoon has been known to be buried 
before now in the belief that he was dead and it struck me that queen maguncia ought to have 
swooned rather than died because with life a great many things come right and the princesss 
folly was not so great that she need feel it so keenly if the lady had married some page of 
hers or some other servant of the house as many another has done so i have heard say then 
the mischief would have been past curing but to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman 
as has been just now described to usindeed indeed though it was a folly it was not such a 
great one as you think for according to the rules of my master hereand he wont allow me to 
lieas of men of letters bishops are made so of gentlemen knights specially if they be errant 
kings and emperors may be made thou art right sancho said don quixote for with a knighterrant 
if he has but two fingers breadth of good fortune it is on the cards to become the mightiest 
lord on earth but let senora the distressed one proceed for i suspect she has got yet to 
tell us the bitter part of this so far sweet story the bitter is indeed to come said the countess 
and such bitter that colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison the queen 
then being dead and not in a swoon we buried her and hardly had we covered her with earth 
hardly had we said our last farewells when quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis over 
the queens grave there appeared mounted upon a wooden horse the giant malambruno maguncias 
first cousin who besides being cruel is an enchanter and he to revenge the death of his 
cousin punish the audacity of don clavijo and in wrath at the contumacy of antonomasia 
left them both enchanted by his art on the grave itself she being changed into an ape of 
brass and he into a horrible crocodile of some unknown metal while between the two there 
stands a pillar also of metal with certain characters in the syriac language inscribed 
upon it which being translated into kandian and now into castilian contain the following 
sentence these two rash lovers shall not recover their former shape until the valiant 
manchegan comes to do battle with me in single combat for the fates reserve this unexampled 
adventure for his mighty valour alone this done he drew from its sheath a huge broad scimitar 
and seizing me by the hair he made as though he meant to cut my throat and shear my head clean 
off i was terrorstricken my voice stuck in my throat and i was in the deepest distress nevertheless 
i summoned up my strength as well as i could and in a trembling and piteous voice i addressed 
such words to him as induced him to stay the infliction of a punishment so severe he then 
caused all the duennas of the palace those that are here present to be brought before him 
and after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence and denounced duennas their characters 
their evil ways and worse intrigues laying to the charge of all what i alone was guilty 
of he said he would not visit us with capital punishment but with others of a slow nature 
which would be in effect civil death for ever and the very instant he ceased speaking we 
all felt the pores of our faces opening and pricking us as if with the points of needles 
we at once put our hands up to our faces and found ourselves in the state you now see here 
the distressed one and the other duennas raised the veils with which they were covered 
and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards some red some black some white 
and some grizzled at which spectacle the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with 
wonder don quixote and sancho were overwhelmed with amazement and the bystanders lost 
in astonishment while the trifaldi went on to say thus did that malevolent villain malambruno 
punish us covering the tenderness and softness of our faces with these rough bristles 
would to heaven that he had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar instead of obscuring 
the light of our countenances with these woolcombings that cover us for if we look into 
the matter sirs and what i am now going to say i would say with eyes flowing like fountains 
only that the thought of our misfortune and the oceans they have already wept keep them 
as dry as barley spears and so i say it without tears where i ask can a duenna with a beard 
to to what father or mother will feel pity for her who will help her for if even when she has 
a smooth skin and a face tortured by a thousand kinds of washes and cosmetics she can hardly 
get anybody to love her what will she do when she shows a countenace turned into a thicket 
oh duennas companions mine it was an unlucky moment when we were born and an illstarred 
hour when our fathers begot us and as she said this she showed signs of being about to faint 
chapter xl of matters relating and belonging to this adventure and to this memorable 
history chapter xli of the arrival of clavileno and the end of this protracted adventure 
and now night came and with it the appointed time for the arrival of the famous horse clavileno 
the nonappearance of which was already beginning to make don quixote uneasy for it struck 
him that as malambruno was so long about sending it either he himself was not the knight 
for whom the adventure was reserved or else malambruno did not dare to meet him in single 
combat but lo suddenly there came into the garden four wildmen all clad in green ivy bearing 
on their shoulders a great wooden horse they placed it on its feet on the ground and one 
of the wildmen said let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine here sancho exclaimed 
i dont mount for neither have i the heart nor am i a knight and let the squire if he has one 
continued the wildman take his seat on the croup and let him trust the valiant malambruno 
for by no sword save his nor by the malice of any other shall he be assailed it is but to turn 
this peg the horse has in his neck and he will bear them through the air to where malambruno 
awaits them but lest the vast elevation of their course should make them giddy their eyes 
must be covered until the horse neighs which will be the sign of their having completed 
their journey with these words leaving clavileno behind them they retired with easy 
dignity the way they came as soon as the distressed one saw the horse almost in tears she 
exclaimed to don quixote valiant knight the promise of malambruno has proved trustworthy 
the horse has come our beards are growing and by every hair in them all of us implore thee 
to shave and shear us as it is only mounting him with thy squire and making a happy beginning 
with your new journey that i will senora countess trifaldi said don quixote most gladly 
and with right goodwill without stopping to take a cushion or put on my spurs so as not to 
lose time such is my desire to see you and all these duennas shaved clean that i wont said 
sancho with goodwill or badwill or any way at all and if this shaving cant be done without 
my mounting on the croup my master had better look out for another squire to go with him 
and these ladies for some other way of making their faces smooth im no witch to have a taste 
for travelling through the air what would my islanders say when they heard their governor 
was going strolling about on the winds and another thing as it is three thousand and odd 
leagues from this to kandy if the horse tires or the giant takes huff well be half a dozen 
years getting back and there wont be isle or island in the world that will know me and so 
as it is a common saying in delay theres danger and when they offer thee a heifer run with 
a halter these ladies beards must excuse me saint peter is very well in rome the two gentlemen 
pressed don quixote to come into their room and have supper with them as they knew very 
well there was nothing in that inn fit for one of his sort don quixote who was always polite 
yielded to their request and supped with them sancho stayed behind with the stew and invested 
with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head of the table he said if your 
worship will give me leave i will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this 
matter of seats the moment sancho said this don quixote trembled making sure that he was 
about to say something foolish sancho glanced at him and guessing his thoughts said dont 
be afraid of my going astray senor or saying anything that wont be pat to the purpose i havent 
forgotten the advice your worship gave me just now about talking much or little well or 
ill i have no recollection of anything sancho said don quixote say what thou wilt only 
say it quickly well then said sancho what i am going to say but the fact of the matter is my 
master don quixote is just as much enchanted as my mother he is in his full senses he eats 
and he drinks and he has his calls like other men and as he had yesterday before they caged 
him and if thats the case what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted 
for i have heard many a one say that enchanted people neither eat nor sleep nor talk and 
my master if you dont stop him will talk more than thirty lawyers then turning to the curate 
he exclaimed ah senor curate senor curate do you think i dont know you do you think i dont 
guess and see the drift of these new enchantments well then i can tell you i know you for 
all your face is covered and i can tell you i fancy i hear their arrows whistling past my 
ears this minute thou art a coward by nature sancho said don quixote but lest thou shouldst 
say i am obstinate and that i never do as thou dost advise this once i will take thy advice 
and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou so dreadest but it must be on one condition that 
never in life or in death thou art to say to anyone that i retired or withdrew from this danger 
out of fear but only in compliance with thy entreaties for if thou sayest otherwise thou 
wilt lie therein and from this time to that and from that to this i give thee lie and say thou 
liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it and answer me not again for at the 
mere thought that i am withdrawing or retiring from any danger above all from this which 
does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with it i am ready to take my stand here and 
await alone not only that holy brotherhood you talk of and dread but the brothers of the 
twelve tribes of israel and the seven maccabees and castor and pollux and all the brothers 
and brotherhoods in the world senor replied sancho to retire is not to flee and there is 
no wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope and it is the part of wise men to preserve 
themselves today for tomorrow and not risk all in one day and let me tell you though i am 
a clown and a boor i have got some notion of what they call safe conduct so repent not of having 
taken my advice but mount rocinante if you can and if not i will help you and follow me for 
my motherwit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now don quixote mounted 
without replying and sancho leading the way on his ass they entered the side of the sierra 
morena which was close by as it was sanchos design to cross it entirely and come out again 
at el viso or almodovar del campo and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the 
search of the brotherhood should they come to look for them he was encouraged in this by 
perceiving that the stock of provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray 
with the galley slaves a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle seeing how they pillaged 
and ransacked that night they reached the very heart of the sierra morena where it seemed 
prudent to sancho to pass the night and even some days at least as many as the stores he carried 
might last and so they encamped between two rocks and among some cork trees but fatal destiny 
which according to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith directs 
arranges and settles everything in its own way so ordered it that gines de pasamonte the 
famous knave and thief who by the virtue and madness of don quixote had been released from 
the chain driven by fear of the holy brotherhood which he had good reason to dread resolved 
to take hiding in the mountains and his fate and fear led him to the same spot to which don 
quixote and sancho panza had been led by theirs just in time to recognise them and leave 
them to fall asleep and as the wicked are always ungrateful and necessity leads to evildoing 
and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future gines who was neither 
grateful nor wellprincipled made up his mind to steal sancho panzas ass not troubling 
himself about rocinante as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell while 
sancho slept he stole his ass and before day dawned he was far out of reach aurora made her 
appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to sancho panza for he found that 
his dapple was missing and seeing himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful 
lament in the world so loud that don quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him saying 
o son of my bowels born in my very house my childrens plaything my wifes joy the envy of my 
neighbours relief of my burdens and lastly half supporter of myself for with the sixandtwenty 
maravedis thou didst earn me daily i met half my charges don quixote when he heard the lament 
and learned the cause consoled sancho with the best arguments he could entreating him 
to be patient and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five 
asscolts that he had at home to be given to him sancho took comfort at this dried his tears 
suppressed his sobs and returned thanks for the kindness shown him by don quixote he on 
his part resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess marcela and make offer to her of all 
the service he could render her but things did not fall out with him as he expected according 
to what is related in the course of this veracious history of which the second part ends 
here chapter xv in which is related the unfortunate adventure that don quixote fell in 
with when he fell out with certain heartless yanguesans the sage cide hamete benengeli 
relates that as soon as don quixote had ensconced himself in the forest oak grove or wood 
near el toboso he bade sancho return to the city and not come into his presence again without 
having first spoken on his behalf to his lady dulcinea and said he was not to be uneasy as 
to the payment of his services for before leaving home he had made his will in which he would 
find himself fully recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he 
had served but if god delivered him safe sound and unhurt out of that danger he might look 
upon the promised island as much more than certain sancho began to weep afresh on again 
hearing the affecting words of his good master and resolved to stay with him until the 
final issue and end of the business from these tears and this honourable resolve of sancho 
panzas the author of this history infers that he must have been of good birth and at least 
an old christian and the feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to make him 
show any weakness on the contrary hiding what he felt as well as he could he began to move 
towards that quarter whence the sound of the water and of the strokes seemed to come sancho 
followed him on foot leading by the halter as his custom was his ass his constant comrade 
in prosperity or adversity and advancing some distance through the shady chestnut trees 
they came upon a little meadow at the foot of some high rocks down which a mighty rush of 
water flung itself at the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed houses looking 
more like ruins than houses from among which came they perceived the din and clatter of 
blows which still continued without intermission rocinante took fright at the noise 
of the water and the rustling of the leaves everything inspired awe and dread more especially 
as they perceived that the strokes did not cease nor the wind lull nor morning approach 
to all which might be added their ignorance as to where they were but don quixote supported 
by his intrepid heart leaped on rocinante and bracing his buckler on his arm and attacked 
the biscayan bent upon taking his life the biscayan when he saw him coming on though he 
wished to dismount from his mule in which being one of those sorry ones let out for hire 
he had no confidence had no choice but to draw his sword it was lucky for him however that 
he was near the coach from which he was able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield 
and they went at one another as if they had been two mortal enemies the others strove to 
make peace between them but could not for the biscayan declared in his disjointed phrase 
that if they did not let him out the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such 
a gentleman as his master required the curate understood him and said he would very gladly 
comply with his request only that he feared his master finding himself at liberty would 
take to his old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him again i will answer 
for his not running away said sancho and i also said the canon especially if he gives me 
his word as a knight not to leave us without our consent don quixote who was listening to 
all that passed and he was right as is shown in the following chapter chapter xxxv wherein 
is continued the instruction given to don quixote touching the disenchantment of dulcinea 
together with other marvellous incidents chapter xxxvi wherein is related the strange 
and undreamtof adventure of the distressed duenna alias the countess trifaldi together 
with a letter which sancho panza wrote to his wife teresa panza the duke had a majordomo 
of a very facetious and sportive turn and he it was that played the part of merlin made all 
the arrangements for the late adventure composed the verses and got a page to represent 
dulcinea and now with the assistance of his master and mistress he got up another of the 
drollest and strangest contrivances that can be imagined the duchess asked sancho the 
next day if he had made a beginning with his grand purpose but scarcely did he find himself 
upon the open plain when a terrible thought struck him one all but enough to make him abandon 
the enterprise at the very outset it occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight 
for it was plain to him he could not lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving 
the order of knighthood chapter iii wherein is related the droll way in which don quixote 
had himself dubbed a knight harassed by this reflection he made haste with his scanty 
pothouse supper and having finished it called the landlord and shutting himself into 
the stable with him fell on his knees before him saying from this spot i rise not valiant 
knight until your courtesy grants me the boon i seek one that will redound to your praise 
and the benefit of the human race the landlord seeing his guest at his feet and hearing 
a speech of this kind stood staring at him in bewilderment not knowing what to do or say 
and entreating him to rise but all to no purpose until he had agreed to grant the boon demanded 
of him i looked for no less my lord from your high magnificence replied don quixote and 
i have to tell you that the common people consider your worship a mighty great madman and 
me no less a fool the hidalgos say that not keeping within the bounds of your quality of 
gentleman you have assumed the don and made a knight of yourself at a jump with four vinestocks 
and a couple of acres of land and never a shirt to your back the caballeros say they do not 
want to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them particularly squire hidalgos 
who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with green silk that said don 
quixote does not apply to me for i always go well dressed and never patched ragged i may 
be but ragged more from the wear and tear of arms than of time as to your worships valour 
courtesy accomplishments and task there is a variety of opinions some say mad but droll 
others valiant but unlucky others courteous but meddling and then they go into such a 
number of things that they dont leave a whole bone either in your worship or in myself recollect 
sancho said don quixote that wherever virtue exists in an eminent degree it is persecuted 
few or none of the famous men that have lived escaped being calumniated by malice julius 
caesar the boldest wisest and bravest of captains was charged with being ambitious and 
not particularly cleanly in his dress or pure in his morals of alexander whose deeds won 
him the name of great they say that he was somewhat of a drunkard of hercules him of the many 
labours it is said that he was lewd and luxurious of don galaor the brother of amadis of 
gaul because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion and was no finikin knight 
nor lachrymose like his brother while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him 
in short he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise 
and his days from dawn to dark poring over them and what with little sleep and much reading 
his brains got so dry that he lost his wits his fancy grew full of what he used to read about 
in his books enchantments quarrels battles challenges wounds wooings loves agonies 
and all sorts of impossible nonsense and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric 
of invention and fancy he read of was true that to him no history in the world had more reality 
in it he used to say the cid ruy diaz was a very good knight but that he was not to be compared 
with the knight of the burning sword who with one backstroke cut in half two fierce and 
monstrous giants he thought more of bernardo del carpio because at roncesvalles he slew 
roland in spite of enchantments availing himself of the artifice of hercules when he 
strangled antaeus the son of terra in his arms he approved highly of the giant morgante 
because although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and illconditioned he alone 
was affable and wellbred but above all he admired reinaldos of montalban especially 
when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met and when beyond 
the seas he stole that image of mahomet which as his history says was entirely of gold to 
have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a ganelon he would have given his housekeeper 
and his niece into the bargain in short his wits being quite gone he hit upon the strangest 
notion that ever madman in this world hit upon and that was that he fancied it was right 
and requisite as well for the support of his own honour as for the service of his country 
that he should make a knighterrant of himself roaming the world over in full armour and 
on horseback in quest of adventures and putting in practice himself all that he had read 
of as being the usual practices of knightserrant righting every kind of wrong and exposing 
himself to peril and danger from which in the issue he was to reap eternal renown and fame 
already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his arm she answered with great 
humility that she was called la tolosa and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of toledo 
who lived in the stalls of sanchobienaya and that wherever she might be she would serve 
and esteem him as her lord don quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward 
she assumed the don and called herself dona tolosa she promised she would and then the 
other buckled on his spur and with her followed almost the same conversation as with the 
lady of the sword he asked her name and she said it was la molinera and that she was the daughter 
of a cobbler of toledo who lived in the stalls of sanchobienaya and that wherever she might 
be she would serve and esteem him as her lord don quixote said in reply that she would do 
him a favour if thenceforward she assumed the don and called herself dona tolosa she promised 
she would and then the other buckled on his spur and with her followed almost the same conversation 
as with the lady of the sword he asked her name and she said it was la molinera and that she 
was the daughter of a respectable miller of antequera and of her likewise don quixote 
requested that she would adopt the don and call herself dona molinera making offers to 
her further services and favours having thus with hot haste and speed brought to a conclusion 
these nevertillnowseen ceremonies don quixote was on thorns until he saw himself on 
horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures and saddling rocinante at once he mounted 
and embracing his host as he returned thanks for his kindness in knighting him he addressed 
him in language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report 
it the landlord to get him out of the inn replied with no less rhetoric though with shorter 
words and without calling upon him to pay the reckoning let him go with a godspeed chapter 
iv of what happened to our knight when he left the inn day was dawning when don quixote quitted 
the inn so happy so gay so exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight that his joy 
was like to burst his horsegirths however recalling the advice of his host as to the requisites 
he ought to carry with him especially that referring to money and shirts he determined 
to go home and provide himself with all and also with a squire for he reckoned upon securing 
a farmlabourer a neighbour of his a poor man with a family but very well qualified for the 
office of squire to a knight with this object he turned his horses head towards his village 
and rocinante thus reminded of his old quarters stepped out so briskly that he hardly 
seemed to tread the earth he had not gone far when out of a thicket on his right there seemed 
to come feeble cries as of some one in distress and the instant he heard them he exclaimed 
thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me that it so soon offers me an opportunity 
of fulfilling the obligation i have undertaken and gathering the fruit of my ambition 
these cries no doubt come from some man or woman in want of help and needing my aid and protection 
and wheeling he turned rocinante in the direction whence the cries seemed to proceed 
he had gone but a few paces into the wood when he saw a mare tied to an oak and tied to another 
and stripped from the waist upwards a youth of about fifteen years of age from whom the 
cries came nor were they without cause for a lusty farmer was flogging him with a belt and 
following up every blow with scoldings and commands repeating your mouth shut and your 
eyes open while the youth made answer i wont do it again master mine by gods passion i wont 
do it again and ill take more care of the flock another time seeing what was going on don 
quixote said in an angry voice discourteous knight it ill becomes you to assail one who 
cannot defend himself mount your steed and take your lance for there was a lance leaning 
against the oak to which the mare was tied and i will make you know that you are behaving 
as a coward the farmer seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance 
over his head gave himself up for dead and made answer meekly sir knight this youth that 
i am chastising is my servant employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that i have hard by 
and he is so careless that i lose one every day and when i punish him for his carelessness 
and knavery he says i do it out of niggardliness to escape paying him the wages i owe him 
and before god and on my soul he lies lies before me base clown said don quixote by the sun 
that shines on us i have a mind to run you through with this lance pay him at once without 
another word if not by the god that rules us i will make an end of you and annihilate you on 
the spot release him instantly the farmer hung his head and without a word untied his servant 
of whom don quixote asked how much his master owed him he replied nine months at seven reals 
a month don quixote added it up found that it came to sixtythree reals and told the farmer 
to pay it down immediately if he did not want to die for it the trembling clown replied that 
as he lived and by the oath he had sworn though he had not sworn any it was not so much for there 
were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him and a real 
for two bloodlettings when he was sick all that is very well said don quixote but let the 
shoes and the bloodlettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him without 
any cause for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for you have damaged that of 
his body and if the barber took blood from him when he was sick you have drawn it when he was 
sound so on that score he owes you nothing the difficulty is sir knight that i have no money 
here let andres come home with me and i will pay him all real by real i go with him said the 
youth nay god forbid no senor not for the world for once alone with me he would ray me like 
a saint bartholomew he will do nothing of the kind said don quixote i have only to command 
and he will obey me and as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which i profess to 
offer to anyone much less to highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be the 
girls were looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy 
visor obscured but when they heard themselves called maidens a thing so much out of their 
line they could not restrain their laughter which made don quixote wax indignant and 
say modesty becomes the fair and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness 
this however i say not to pain or anger you for my desire is none other than to serve you the 
incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier only increased 
the ladies laughter and that increased his irritation and matters might have gone farther 
if at that moment the landlord had not come out who being a very fat man was a very peaceful 
one he seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than his 
saddle bridle lance buckler or corselet was not at all indisposed to join the damsels 
in their manifestations of amusement but in truth standing in awe of such a complicated 
armament he thought it best to speak him fairly so he said senor caballero if your worship 
wants lodging bating the bed for there is not one in the world i will not compel to give ground 
as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself replied the master of fence 
though it might be that your grave would be dug on the spot where you planted your foot the 
first time i mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword 
we shall soon see replied corchuelo and getting off his ass briskly he drew out furiously 
one of the swords the licentiate carried on his beast it must not be that way said don quixote 
at this point i will be the director of this fencing match and judge of this often disputed 
question and dismounting from rocinante and grasping his lance he planted himself in 
the middle of the road stood waiting the approach of these knightserrant for such he now 
considered and held them to be and when they had come near enough to hear what he said he 
cried aloud devilish and unnatural beings release instantly the highborn princesses 
whom you are carrying off by force in this coach else prepare to meet a speedy death as the 
just punishment of your evil deeds the friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance 
of don quixote as well as at his words to which they replied senor caballero we are not devilish 
or unnatural but two brothers of st benedict following our road nor do we know whether 
or not there are any captive princesses coming in this coach no soft words with me for i 
know you lying rabble said don quixote and without waiting for a reply he spurred rocinante 
and with levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination that 
if the friar had not flung himself off the mule he would have brought him to the ground against 
his will and sore wounded if not killed outright the second brother seeing how his comrade 
was treated drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster 
than the wind sancho panza when he saw the friar on the ground dismounting briskly from 
his ass rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown at that instant the friars muleteers 
came up and asked what he was stripping him for sancho answered them that this fell to him 
lawfully as spoil of the battle which his lord don quixote had won the muleteers who had 
no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils seeing that don 
quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach fell upon sancho 
knocked him down and leaving hardly a hair in his beard belaboured him with kicks and left 
him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground and without any more delay helped 
the friar to mount who trembling terrified and pale as soon as he found himself in the saddle 
spurred after his companion who was standing at a distance looking on watching the result 
of the onslaught then not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun they pursued 
their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them don quixote was 
as has been said speaking to the lady in the coach your beauty lady mine said he may now dispose 
of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure for the pride of your ravishers 
lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine and lest you should be pining 
to know the name of your deliverer know that i am called don quixote of la mancha at this 
instant don quixote began shouting out here here valiant knights here is need for you 
to put forth the might of your strong arms for they of the court are gaining the mastery 
in the tourney called away by this noise and outcry they proceeded no farther with the 
scrutiny of the remaining books and so it is thought that the carolea the lion of spain 
and the deeds of the emperor written by don luis de avila went to the fire unseen and unheard 
for no doubt they were among those that remained and perhaps if the curate had seen them 
they would not have undergone so severe a sentence when they reached don quixote he was 
already out of bed and was still shouting and raving and slashing and cutting all round 
as wide awake as if he had never slept they closed with him and by force got him back to bed 
and when he had become a little calm addressing the curate he said to him of a truth senor 
archbishop turpin it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves the twelve peers so 
carelessly to allow the knights of the court to gain the victory in this tourney we the 
adventurers having carried off the honour on the three former days hush gossip said the 
curate please god the luck may turn and what is lost today may be won tomorrow for the present 
let your worship have a care of your health for it seems to me that you are overfatigued 
if not badly wounded wounded no said don quixote but bruised and battered no doubt for 
that bastard don roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree and all for envy because 
he sees that i alone rival him in his achievements but i should not call myself reinaldos 
of montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as i rise from 
this bed for the present let them bring me something to eat for that i feel is what will be 
more to my purpose and leave it to me to avenge myself they did as he wished they gave him 
something to eat and made him as comfortable as possible chapter lxxiv of how don quixote 
fell sick and of the will he made and how he died as nothing that is mans can last for ever 
but all tends ever downwards from its beginning to its end and above all mans life and as 
don quixotes enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay its course its end and 
close came when he least looked for it forwhether it was of the dejection the thought of 
his defeat produced or of heavens will that so ordered ita fever settled upon him and kept 
him in his bed for six days during which he was often visited by his friends the curate the 
bachelor and the barber while his good squire sancho panza never quitted his bedside 
they persuaded that it was grief at finding himself vanquished and the object of his heart 
the liberation and disenchantment of dulcinea unattained that kept him in this state 
strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up the bachelor bidding him take heart 
and get up to begin his pastoral life for which he himself he said had already composed 
an eclogue that would take the shine out of all sannazaro had ever written and had bought 
with his own money two famous dogs to guard the flock one called barcino and the other butron 
which a herdsman of quintanar had sold him but for all this don quixote could not shake 
off his sadness his friends called in the doctor who felt his pulse and was not very well 
satisfied with it and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to the health 
of his soul as that of his body was in a bad way don quixote heard this calmly but not so his 
housekeeper his niece and his squire who fell weeping bitterly as if they had him lying 
dead before them the doctors opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing 
him to his end don quixote begged them to leave him to himself as he had a wish to sleep a little 
they obeyed and he slept at one stretch as the saying is more than six hours so that the housekeeper 
and niece thought he was going to sleep for ever but at the end of that time when the bano 
was as it generally was empty it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it promised a happy 
birth reed and cloth came down to me and i found another paper and a hundred crowns in gold 
without any other coin the renegade was present and in our cell we gave him the paper to 
read which was to this effect i cannot think of a plan senor for our going to spain nor has 
lela marien shown me one though i have asked her all that can be done is for me to give you 
plenty of money in gold from this window with it ransom yourself and your friends and let 
one of you go to the land of the christians so that she might feel satisfied and easy he had 
never been able to do so for the moorish women do not allow themselves to be seen by any moor 
or turk unless their husband or father bid them with christian captives they permit freedom 
of intercourse and communication even more than might be considered proper but for my 
part i should have been sorry if he had spoken to her for perhaps it might have alarmed her 
to find her affairs talked of by renegades but god who ordered it otherwise afforded no 
opportunity for our renegades wellmeant purpose and he seeing how safely he could go 
to shershel and return and anchor when and how and where he liked and that the tagarin his 
partner had no will but his and that now i was ransomed all we wanted was to find some christians 
to row told me to look out for any i should be willing to take with me over and above those 
who had been ransomed and to engage them for the next friday which he fixed upon for our 
departure on this i spoke to twelve spaniards all stout rowers and such as could most easily 
leave the city but it was no easy matter to find so many just then because there were twenty 
ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the rowers with them and these would not have 
been found were it not that their master remained at home that summer without going to 
sea in order to finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks to these men i said nothing more 
than that the next friday in the evening they were to come out stealthily one by one and 
hang about hadji moratos garden waiting for me there until i came these directions i gave 
each one separately with orders that if they saw any other christians there they were 
not to say anything to them except that i had directed them to wait at that spot this preliminary 
having been settled another still more necessary step had to be taken which was to let 
zoraida know how matters stood that she might be prepared and forewarned so as not to be 
taken by surprise if we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the christians 
vessel could have returned i determined therefore to go to the garden and try if i could 
speak to her and the day before my departure i went there under the pretence of gathering 
herbs the first person i met was her father who addressed me in the language that all over 
barbary and even in constantinople is the medium between captives and moors and is neither 
morisco nor castilian nor of any other nation but a mixture of all languages by means of 
which we can all understand one another in this sort of language i say he asked me what i 
wanted in his garden and to whom i belonged i replied that i was a slave of the arnaut mami 
for i knew as a certainty that he was a very great friend of his and that i wanted some herbs 
to make a salad he asked me then whether i were on ransom or not and what my master demanded 
for me while these questions and answers were proceeding the fair zoraida who had already 
perceived me some time before came out of the house in the garden and as moorish women are 
by no means particular about letting themselves be seen by christians or as i have said 
before at all coy she had no hesitation in coming to where her father stood with me moreover 
her father seeing her approaching slowly called to her to come it would be beyond my power 
now to describe to you the great beauty the highbred air the brilliant attire of my beloved 
zoraida as she presented herself before my eyes i will content myself with saying that 
more pearls hung from her fair neck her ears and her hair than she had hairs on her head on 
her ankles which as is customary were bare she had carcajes for so bracelets or anklets 
are called in morisco of the purest gold set with so many diamonds that she told me afterwards 
her father valued them at ten thousand doubloons and those she had on her wrists were worth 
as much more the pearls were in profusion and very fine for the highest display and adornment 
of the moorish women is decking themselves with rich pearls and seedpearls and of these 
there are therefore more among the moors than among any other people zoraidas father 
had to the reputation of possessing a great number and the purest in all algiers and of 
possessing also more than two hundred thousand spanish crowns and she who is now mistress 
of me only was mistress of all this whether thus adorned she would have been beautiful 
or not and what she must have been in her prosperity may be imagined from the beauty remaining 
to her after so many hardships for as everyone knows the beauty of some women has its times 
and its seasons and is increased or diminished by chance causes and naturally the emotions 
of the mind will heighten or impair it though indeed more frequently they totally destroy 
it in a word she presented herself before me that day attired with the utmost splendour 
and supremely beautiful at any rate she seemed to me the most beautiful object i had ever 
seen and when besides i thought of all i owed to her i felt as though i had before me some heavenly 
being come to earth to bring me relief and happiness as she approached her father told 
her in his own language that i was a captive belonging to his friend the arnaut mami and 
that i had come for salad she took up the conversation and in that mixture of tongues i have 
spoken of she asked me if i was a gentleman and why i was not ransomed i answered that i was 
already ransomed and that by the price it might be seen what value my master set on me as 
i had given one thousand five hundred zoltanis for me to which she replied hadst thou been 
my fathers i can tell thee i would not have let him part with thee for twice as much for you 
christians always tell lies about yourselves and make yourselves out poor to cheat the 
moors that may be lady said i but indeed i dealt truthfully with my master as i do and mean 
to do with everybody in the world and when dost thou go said zoraida tomorrow i think said 
i for there is a vessel here from france which sails tomorrow and i think i shall go in her 
would it not be better said zoraida to wait for the arrival of ships from spain and go with 
them and not with the french who are not your friends no said i though if there were intelligence 
that a vessel were now coming from spain it is true i might perhaps wait for it however it 
is more likely i shall depart tomorrow for the longing i feel to return to my country and 
to those i love is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity however 
more convenient if it be delayed no doubt thou art married in thine own country said zoraida 
and for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife i am not married i replied but 
i have given my promise to marry on my arrival there and is the lady beautiful to whom thou 
hast given it said zoraida so beautiful said i that to describe her worthily and tell thee 
the truth she is very like thee at this her father laughed very heartily and said by allah 
christian she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter who is the most beautiful 
woman in all this kingdom only look at her well and thou wilt see i am telling the truth zoraidas 
father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these words and phrases for 
though she spoke the bastard language that as i have said is employed there she expressed 
her meaning more by signs than by words while we were still engaged in this conversation 
a moor came running up exclaiming that four turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the 
garden and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe the old man was alarmed and 
zoraida too for the moors commonly and so to speak instinctively have a dread of the turks 
but particularly of the soldiers who are so insolent and domineering to the moors who 
are under their power that they treat them worse than if they were their slaves her father 
said to zoraida daughter retire into the house and shut thyself in while i go and speak 
to these dogs and thou christian pick thy herbs and go in peace and allah bring thee safe 
to thy own country i bowed and he went away to look for the turks leaving me alone with zoraida 
who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade her but the moment he was concealed 
by the trees of the garden turning to me with her eyes full of tears she said tameji cristiano 
tameji that is to say art thou going christian art thou going i made answer yes lady but 
not without thee come what may be on the watch for me on the next juma and be not alarmed when 
thou seest us for most surely we shall go to the land of the christians to see lela marien 
who had great love for me i know not how to go i have seen many christians but except thyself 
none has seemed to me to be a packsaddle as thou wert fixing it was it a flatsaddle or a sidesaddle 
it was neither replied sancho but a jineta saddle with a field covering worth half a kingdom 
so rich is it and that i could not see all this sancho said don quixote once more i say and 
will say a thousand times i am the most unfortunate of men sancho the rogue had enough to 
do to hide his laughter at hearing the simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled 
at length after a good deal more conversation had passed between them they remounted 
their beasts and followed the road to saragossa which they expected to reach in time to 
take part in a certain grand festival which is held every year in that illustrious city 
but before they got there things happened to them so many so important and so strange that 
they deserve to be recorded and read as will be seen farther on chapter l wherein is set 
forth who the enchanters and executioners were who flogged the duenna and pinched don 
quixote and also what befell the page who carried the letter to teresa panza sancho panzas 
wife chapter li of the progress of sanchos government and other such entertaining matters 
day came after the night of the governors round a night which the headcarver passed without 
sleeping so were his thoughts of the face and air and beauty of the disguised damsel while 
the majordomo spent what was left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all 
sancho said and did being as much amazed at his sayings as at his doings for there was a mixture 
of shrewdness and simplicity in all his words and deeds the senor governor got up and by 
doctor pedro recios directions they made him break his fast on a little conserve and four 
sups of cold water which sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a 
bunch of grapes but seeing there was no help for it the landlady the landlord their daughter 
and maritornes when they saw don quixote and sancho coming went out to welcome them with 
signs of hearty satisfaction which don quixote received with dignity and gravity and 
bade them make up a better bed for him than the last time to which the landlady replied that 
there was not a hands breadth of the whole inn unoccupied still for all that said one of 
those who had entered on horseback room must be found for his lordship the judge here at 
this name the landlady was taken aback and said senor the fact is i have no beds but if his 
lordship the judge carries one with him as no doubt he does let him come in and welcome for 
my husband and i will give up our room to accommodate his worship very good so be it said 
the squire but in the meantime a man had got out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance 
the office and post he held for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that 
he was as his servant said a judge of appeal he led by the hand a young girl in a travelling 
dress apparently about sixteen years of age and of such a highbred air so beautiful and 
so graceful that all were filled with admiration when she made her appearance and but 
for having seen dorothea luscinda and zoraida who were there in the inn they would have 
fancied that a beauty like that of this maidens would have been hard to find don quixote 
was present at the entrance of the judge with the young lady and as soon as he saw him his 
owner said i was wondering he did not answer for if he wasnt dead hed have brayed when he 
heard us or hed have been no ass but for the sake of having heard you bray to such perfection 
gossip i count the trouble i have taken to look for him well bestowed even though i have 
found him dead its in a good hand gossip said the other if the abbot sings well the acolyte 
is not much behind him so they returned disconsolate and hoarse to their village where 
they told their friends neighbours and acquaintances what had befallen them in their 
search for the ass each crying up the others perfection in braying the whole story came 
to be known and spread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood and the devil 
who never sleeps with his love for sowing dissensions and scattering discord everywhere 
blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of nothing contrived to make the people 
of the other towns fall to braying whenever they saw anyone from our village as if to throw 
the braying of our regidors in our teeth then the boys took to it which was the same thing 
for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of hell and braying spread 
from one town to another in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her virtue as 
the fire proves that of gold because i am persuaded my friend that a woman is virtuous only 
in proportion as she is or is not tempted and that she alone is strong who does not yield 
to the promises gifts tears and importunities of earnest lovers for what thanks does 
a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad and what wonder is it that she 
is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows 
she has a husband that will take her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety 
i do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same 
estimation as her who comes out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory and so for 
these reasons and many others that i could give thee to justify and support the opinion 
i hold i am desirous that my wife camilla should pass this crisis and be refined and tested 
by the fire of finding herself wooed and by one worthy to set his affections upon her and 
if she comes out as i know she will victorious from this struggle i shall look upon my good 
fortune as unequalled i shall be able to say that the cup of my desire is full and that the 
virtuous woman of whom the sage says who shall find her has fallen to my lot and if the result 
be the contrary of what i expect in the satisfaction of knowing that i have been right in 
my opinion i shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience 
will naturally cause me and as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will 
avail to keep me from carrying it into effect it is my desire friend lothario that thou 
shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this purpose that i am bent upon 
for i will afford thee opportunities to that end and nothing shall be wanting that i may 
think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous honourable modest and highminded woman 
and among other reasons i am induced to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration 
that if camilla be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes but only 
far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone 
thus i shall not be wronged in anything more than intention and my wrong will remain buried 
in the integrity of thy silence which i know well will be as lasting as that of death in what 
concerns me if therefore thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life thou wilt at 
once engage in this love struggle not lukewarmly nor slothfully but with the energy and 
zeal that my desire demands and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of such were 
the words anselmo addressed to lothario who listened to them with such attention that 
except to say what has been already mentioned he did not open his lips until the other had 
finished then perceiving that he had no more to say after regarding him for awhile as one 
would regard something never before seen that excited wonder and amazement he said to 
him i cannot persuade myself anselmo my friend that what thou hast said to me is not in jest 
if i thought that thou wert speaking seriously i would not have allowed thee to go so far 
so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to thee i verily suspect that either 
thou dost not know me or i do not know thee but no i know well thou art anselmo and thou knowest 
that i am lothario the misfortune is it seems to me that thou art not the anselmo thou wert 
and must have thought that i am not the lothario i should be for the things that thou hast 
said to me are not those of that anselmo who was my friend nor are those that thou demandest 
of me what should be asked of the lothario thou knowest true friends will prove their friends 
and make use of them as a poet has said usque ad aras whereby he meant that they will not make 
use of their friendship in things that are contrary to gods will if this then was a heathens 
feeling about friendship how much more should it be a christians who knows that the divine 
must not be forfeited for the sake of any human friendship and if a friend should go so far 
as to put aside his duty to heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend it should not be in matters 
that are trifling or of little moment but in such as affect the friends life and honour 
now tell me anselmo in which of these two art thou imperilled that i should hazard myself 
to gratify thee and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me neither forsooth 
on the contrary thou dost ask of me so far as i understand to strive and labour to rob thee 
of honour and life and to rob myself of them at the same time for if i take away thy honour 
it is plain i take away thy life as a man without honour is worse than dead and being the instrument 
as thou wilt have it so the unhappy and unfortunate dorothea i am that lowly peasant girl 
whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough to call herself 
thine i am she who in the seclusion of innocence led a contented life until at the voice 
of thy importunity and thy true and tender passion as it seemed she opened the gates of 
her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her liberty a gift received by thee but 
thanklessly as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find 
me and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which i see thee nevertheless i would 
not have thee suppose that i have come here driven by my shame it is only grief and sorrow 
at seeing myself forgotten by thee that have led me it was thy will to make me thine and thou 
didst so follow thy will that now even though thou repentest thou canst not help being 
mine bethink thee my lord the unsurpassable affection i bear thee may compensate for 
the beauty and noble birth for which thou wouldst desert me thou canst not be the fair luscindas 
because thou art mine nor can she be thine because she is cardenios and it will be easier 
remember to bend thy will to love one who adores thee than to lead one to love thee who abhors 
thee now thou didst address thyself to my simplicity thou didst lay siege to my virtue 
thou wert not ignorant of my station well dost thou know how i yielded wholly to thy will 
there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception and if it be so as it is and if thou 
art a christian as thou art a gentleman why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making 
me as happy at last as thou didst at first and if thou wilt not have me for what i am thy true 
and lawful wife at least take and accept me as thy slave for so long as i am thine i will count 
myself happy and fortunate do not by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips 
in the streets make not the old age of my parents miserable for the loyal services they 
as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return and if 
thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine reflect that there is little 
or no nobility in the world that has not travelled the same road and that in illustrious 
lineages it is not the womans blood that is of account and moreover that true nobility 
consists in virtue and if thou art wanting in that refusing me what in justice thou owest 
me then even i have higher claims to nobility than thine to make an end senor these are my 
last words to thee whether thou wilt or wilt not i am thy wife witness thy words which must 
not and ought not to be called deception which aims at virtuous ends and the marriage of 
lovers he maintained to be a most excellent end reminding them however that love has no 
greater enemy than hunger and constant want for love is all gaiety enjoyment and happiness 
especially when the lover is in the possession of the object of his desires and camilla 
so happy in having won anselmo for her husband that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven 
and to lothario by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her the first few days those 
of a wedding being usually days of merrymaking lothario frequented his friend anselmos 
house as he had been wont striving to do honour to him and to the occasion and to gratify 
him in every way he could but when the wedding days were over and the succession of visits 
and congratulations had slackened he began purposely to leave off going to the house 
of anselmo for it seemed to him as it naturally would to all men of sense that friends houses 
ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in their masters bachelor 
days because though true and genuine friendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious 
still a married mans honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable to injury 
from brothers much more from friends anselmo remarked the cessation of lotharios visits 
and complained of it to him saying that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from 
enjoying his society as he used he would have never married and that if by the thorough 
harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor they had earned such a sweet 
name as that of the two friends he should not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be 
lost through a needless anxiety to act circumspectly and so he entreated him if such a 
phrase was allowable between them to be once more master of his house and to come in and 
go out as formerly assuring him that his wife camilla had no other desire or inclination 
than that which he would wish her to have and that knowing how sincerely they loved one 
another she was grieved to see such coldness in him to all this and much more that anselmo 
said to lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing 
lothario replied with so much prudence sense and judgment that anselmo was satisfied 
of his friends good intentions and it was agreed that on two days in the week and on holidays 
lothario should come to dine with him but though this arrangement was made between them 
lothario resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with 
the honour of his friend whose good name was more to him than his own he said and justly that 
a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully 
what friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife associated with for 
what cannot be done or arranged in the marketplace in church at public festivals or at 
stations opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives may be easily managed 
in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed lothario 
said too that every married man should have some friend who would point out to him any negligence 
he might be guilty of in his conduct for it will sometimes happen that owing to the deep 
affection the husband bears his wife either he does not caution her or not to vex her refrains 
from telling her to do or not to do certain things doing or avoiding which may be a matter 
of honour or reproach to him and errors of this kind he could easily correct if warned by 
a friend but where is such a friend to be found as lothario would have so judicious so loyal 
and so true of a truth i know not lothario alone was such a one for with the utmost care and 
vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend and strove to diminish cut down and 
reduce the number of days for going to his house according to their agreement lest the 
visits of a young man wealthy highborn and with the attractions he was conscious of possessing 
at the house of a woman so beautiful as camilla should be regarded with suspicion by the 
inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle public for though his integrity and reputation 
might bridle slanderous tongues still he was unwilling to hazard either his own good 
name or that of his friend and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he devoted to 
some other business which he pretended was unavoidable so that a great portion of the 
day was taken up with complaints on one side and excuses on the other it happened however 
that on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside the city anselmo addressed 
the following words to lothario thou mayest suppose lothario my friend that i am unable 
to give sufficient thanks for the favours god has rendered me in making me the son of such 
parents as mine were and bestowing upon me with no niggard hand what are called the gifts 
of nature as well as those of fortune and above all for what he has done in giving me thee 
for a friend and camilla for a wifetwo treasures that i value if not as highly as i ought 
at least as highly as i am able and yet with all these good things which are commonly all 
that men need to enable them to live happily i am the most discontented and dissatisfied 
man in the whole world for i know not how long since i have been harassed and oppressed by 
a desire so strange and so unusual that i wonder at myself and blame and chide myself when 
i am alone and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts and with no better success 
than if i were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world and as in short 
it must come out i would confide it to thy safe keeping feeling sure that by this means and 
by thy readiness as a true friend to afford me relief i shall soon find myself freed from 
the distress it causes me and that thy care will give me happiness in the same degree as 
my own folly has caused me misery the words of anselmo struck lothario with astonishment 
unable as he was to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble and though be strove 
to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend his conjectures were all 
far from the truth and to relieve the anxiety which this perplexity was causing him he 
told him he was doing a flagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous 
methods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts for he well knew he might reckon upon 
his counsel in diverting them or his help in carrying them into effect that is the truth 
replied anselmo and relying upon that i will tell thee friend lothario that the desire 
which harasses me is that of knowing whether my wife camilla is as good and as perfect as 
i think her to be and i cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by testing 
her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her virtue as the fire proves that 
of gold because i am persuaded my friend that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as 
she is or is not tempted and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises gifts 
tears and importunities of earnest lovers for what thanks does a woman deserve for being 
good if no one urges her to be bad and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect 
to whom no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will 
take her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety i do not therefore hold her 
who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes 
out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory and so for these reasons and many others 
that i could give thee to justify and support the opinion i hold i am desirous that my wife 
camilla should pass this crisis and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself 
wooed and by one worthy to set his affections upon her and if she comes out as i know she will 
victorious from this struggle i shall look upon my good fortune as unequalled i shall 
be able to say that the cup of my desire is full and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage 
says who shall find her has fallen to my lot and if the result be the contrary of what i expect 
in the satisfaction of knowing that i have been right in my opinion i shall bear without 
complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me and as 
nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me from carrying 
it into effect it is my desire friend lothario that thou shouldst consent to become the 
instrument for effecting this purpose that i am bent upon for i will afford thee opportunities 
to that end and nothing shall be wanting that i may think necessary for the pursuit of a 
virtuous honourable modest and highminded woman and among other reasons i am induced 
to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that if camilla be conquered 
by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes but only far enough to account that 
accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone thus i shall not be wronged 
in anything more than intention and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy 
silence which i know well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me if therefore 
thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life thou wilt at once engage in this love 
struggle not lukewarmly nor slothfully but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands 
and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of such were the words anselmo addressed 
to lothario who listened to them with such attention that except to say what has been already 
mentioned he did not open his lips until the other had finished then perceiving that he 
had no more to say after regarding him for awhile as one would regard something never before 
seen that excited wonder and amazement he said to him i cannot persuade myself anselmo 
my friend that what thou hast said to me is not in jest if i thought that thou wert speaking 
seriously i would not have allowed thee to go so far so as to put a stop to thy long harangue 
by not listening to thee i verily suspect that either thou dost not know me or i do not know 
thee but no i know well thou art anselmo and thou knowest that i am lothario the misfortune 
is it seems to me that thou art not the anselmo thou wert and must have thought that i am not 
the lothario i should be for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of that anselmo 
who was my friend nor are those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the lothario 
thou knowest true friends will prove their friends and make use of them as a poet has said 
usque ad aras whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship in things 
that are contrary to gods will if this then was a heathens feeling about friendship how 
much more should it be a christians who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for 
the sake of any human friendship and if a friend should go so far as to put aside his duty 
to heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend it should not be in matters that are trifling 
or of little moment but in such as affect the friends life and honour now tell me anselmo 
in which of these two art thou imperilled that i should hazard myself to gratify thee and 
do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me neither forsooth on the contrary thou 
dost ask of me so far as i understand to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life and

not i am thy wife witness thy words which must not and ought not to be false if thou dost pride 
thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me witness the pledge which thou didst 
give me and witness heaven which thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst 
made me and if all this fail thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice 
in the midst of all thy gaiety and vindicate the truth of what i say here is my sword that 
will compel incredulity itself to give credence to it calm yourself sir knight said don 
quixote and give ear to what i am about to say to you i would have you know that i am held enchanted 
in this cage by the envy and fraud of wicked enchanters for virtue is more persecuted by 
the wicked than loved by the good i am a knighterrant and not one of those whose names fame 
has never thought of immortalising in her record but of those who in defiance and in spite 
of envy itself and all the magicians that persia or brahmans that india or gymnosophists 
that ethiopia ever produced will place their names in the temple of immortality to serve 
as examples and patterns for ages to come whereby knightserrant may see the footsteps 
in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in 
arms what senor don quixote of la mancha pattern and image wherein we see contained and 
condensed all that is worthy in knighterrantry don quixote delighted beyond measure 
with such a lordly reception replied to him in words no less courteous all then proceeded 
to the poop which was very handsomely decorated and seated themselves on the bulwark 
benches the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all hands to strip which they 
did in an instant sancho seeing such a number of men stripped to the skin was taken aback 
and still more when he saw them spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him as if all 
the devils were at work at it but all this was cakes and fancy bread to what i am going to tell 
thee my ease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great and it is 
this to go aside a little while i am sleeping in accordance with thy advice and making bare 
thy carcase to the air to give thyself three or four hundred lashes on account of dulcineas 
disenchantment score and this i entreat of thee making it a request for i have no desire 
to come to grips with thee a second time as i know thou hast a heavy hand as soon as thou hast 
laid them on we will pass the rest of the night i singing my separation thou thy constancy 
making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we are to follow at our village senor 
replied sancho im no monk to get up out of the middle of my sleep and scourge myself nor does 
it seem to me that one can pass from one extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music 
will your worship let me sleep and not worry me about whipping myself or youll make me swear 
never to touch a hair of my doublet not to say my flesh o hard heart said don quixote o pitiless 
squire o bread illbestowed and favours illacknowledged both those i have done thee and 
those i mean to do thee through me hast thou seen thyself a governor and through me thou 
seest thyself in immediate expectation of being a count or obtaining some other equivalent 
title for ipost tenebras spero lucem i dont know what that is said sancho all i know is that 
so long as i am asleep i have neither fear nor hope trouble nor glory and good luck betide 
him that invented sleep the cloak that covers over all a mans thoughts the food that removes 
hunger the drink that drives away thirst the fire that warms the cold the cold that tempers 
the heat and to wind up with the universal coin wherewith everything is bought the weight 
and balance that makes the shepherd equal with the king and the fool with the wise man sleep 
i have heard say has only one fault that it is like death for between a sleeping man and a 
dead man there is very little difference never have i heard thee speak so elegantly as 
now sancho said don quixote and here i begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dost sometimes 
quote not with whom thou art bred but with whom thou art fed well then if he be mad as he is 
and with a madness that mostly takes one thing for another and white for black and black 
for white as was seen when he said the windmills were giants and the monks mules dromedaries 
flocks of sheep armies of enemies and much more to the same tune it will not be very hard 
to make him believe that some country girl the first i come across here is the lady dulcinea 
and if he does not believe it ill swear it and if he should swear ill swear again and if he 
persists ill persist still more so as come what may to have my quoit always over the peg 
maybe by holding out in this way i may put a stop to his sending me on messages of this kind 
another time or maybe he will think as i suspect he will that one of those wicked enchanters 
who he says have a spite against him has changed her form for the sake of doing him an ill 
turn and injuring him with this reflection sancho made his mind easy counting the business 
as good as settled and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make don quixote think he 
had time enough to go to el toboso and return and things turned out so luckily for him that 
as he got up to mount dapple he spied coming from el toboso towards the spot where he stood 
three peasant girls on three colts or filliesfor the author does not make the point clear 
though it is more likely they were sheasses the usual mount with village girls but as it 
is of no great consequence we need not stop to prove it to be brief the instant sancho saw 
the peasant girls he returned full speed to seek his master and found him sighing and uttering 
a thousand passionate lamentations when don quixote saw him he exclaimed what news sancho 
my friend am i to mark this day with a white stone as one of the happiest i can expect to enjoy 
in my lifetime since i have seen senor don quixote of la mancha says observed the curate 
is the truth for he goes enchanted in this cart not from any fault or sins of his but because 
of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious and valour hateful this senor is the 
knight of the rueful countenance into the signature i declare your worship is indeed 
the very devil and there is nothing you dont know everything is needed for the calling 
i follow said don quixote now then said sancho let your worship put the order for the three 
asscolts on the other side and sign it very plainly that they may recognise it at first 
sight with all my heart said don quixote and reading it aloud as sancho had requested him 
he found it ran thus thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence 
the news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint ungrateful one 
thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy but not more worthy but if virtue were esteemed 
wealth i should neither envy the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own 
what thy beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low by it i believed thee to be an angel by them 
i know thou art a woman peace be with thee who hast sent war to me and heaven grant that the 
deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from thee so that thou repent not of what thou hast 
done and i reap not a revenge i would not have when he had finished the letter don quixote 
said there is less to be gathered from this than from the verses except that he who wrote 
it is some rejected lover and turning over nearly all the pages of the book he found more 
verses and letters some of which he could read while others he could not but they were all 
made up of complaints laments misgivings desires and aversions favours and rejections 
some rapturous some doleful while don quixote examined the book sancho examined the 
valise not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he did not search peer into 
and explore or seam that he did not rip or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces lest 
anything should escape for want of care and pains so keen was the covetousness excited 
in him by the discovery of the crowns which amounted to near a hundred and though he found 
no more booty he held the blanket flights balsam vomits stake benedictions carriers 
fisticuffs missing alforjas stolen coat and all the hunger thirst and weariness he had 
endured in the service of his good master cheap at the price as he considered himself more 
than fully indemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the treasuretrove 
the knight of the rueful countenance thou needst not doubt it sancho replied don quixote 
for in the same manner and by the same steps as i have described here knightserrant rise 
and have risen to be kings and emperors all we want now is to find out what king christian 
or pagan is at war and has a beautiful daughter and that i have won incredible fame throughout 
the universe i know not how it can be made out that i am of royal lineage or even second cousin 
to an emperor for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless 
he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point however much my famous deeds may deserve 
it so that by this deficiency i fear i shall lose what my arm has fairly earned true it is 
i am a gentleman of known house of estate and property and entitled to the five hundred 
sueldos mulct and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry 
and pedigree that i may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king for i would have 
thee know sancho that the famous amadis of gaul was one of the most perfect knightserranti 
am wrong to say he was one he stood alone the first the only one the lord of all that were in 
the world in his time a fig for don belianis and for all who say he equalled him in any respect 
for my oath upon it they are deceiving themselves i say too that when a painter desires 
to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters 
that he knows and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and callings 
that serve to adorn a state thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate 
ulysses in whose person and labours homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence 
and patience as virgil too shows us in the person of aeneas the virtue of a pious son and 
the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain not representing or describing them as they 
were but as they ought to be so as to leave the example of their virtues to posterity in the 
same way amadis was the polestar daystar sun of valiant and devoted knights whom all we 
who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to imitate this then being so 
i consider friend sancho that the knighterrant who shall imitate him most closely will 
come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry now one of the instances in which 
this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence worth valour endurance fortitude 
and love was when he withdrew rejected by the lady oriana to do penance upon the pena pobre 
changing his name into that of beltenebros a name assuredly significant and appropriate 
to the life which he had voluntarily adopted so as it is easier for me to imitate him in this 
than in cleaving giants asunder cutting off serpents heads slaying dragons routing 
armies destroying fleets and breaking enchantments and as this place is so well suited 
for a similar purpose i must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently 
offers me its forelock what is it in reality said sancho that your worship means to do in 
such an outoftheway place as this have i not told thee answered don quixote that i mean 
to imitate amadis here playing the victim of despair the madman the maniac so as at the 
same time to imitate the valiant don roland when at the fountain he had evidence of the 
fair angelica having disgraced herself with medoro and through grief thereat went mad 
and plucked up trees troubled the waters of the clear springs slew destroyed flocks burned 
down huts levelled houses dragged mares after him and perpetrated a hundred thousand 
other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record and though i have no intention 
of imitating roland or orlando or rotolando for he went by all these names step by step 
in all the mad things he did said and thought i will make a rough copy to the best of my power 
of all that seems to me most essential but perhaps i shall content myself with the simple 
imitation of amadis who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears 
and sorrow gained as much fame as the most famous for according to his history on finding 
himself rejected by his lady oriana who had ordered him not to appear in her presence until 
it should be her pleasure all he did was to retire to the pena pobre in company with a hermit 
and there he took his fill of weeping until heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great 
grief and need and if this be true as it is why should i now take the trouble to strip stark 
naked or do mischief to these trees which have done me no harm or why am i to disturb the clear 
waters of these brooks which will give me to drink whenever i have a mind long live the memory 
of amadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible by don quixote of la mancha of whom 
it will be said as was said of the other that if he did not achieve great things he died in 
attempting them and if i am not repulsed or rejected by my dulcinea it is enough for me as 
i have said to be absent from her and so now to business come to my memory ye deeds of amadis 
and show me how i am to begin to imitate you i know already that what he chiefly did was to 
pray and commend himself to god but what am i to do for a rosary for i have not got one and then 
it occurred to him how he might make one and that was by tearing a great strip off the tail 
of his shirt which hung down and making eleven knots on it one bigger than the rest and this 
served him for a rosary all the time he was there during which he repeated countless avemarias 
but what distressed him greatly was not having another hermit there to confess him and 
receive consolation from and so he solaced himself with pacing up and down the little 
meadow and writing and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude 
of verses all in harmony with his sadness and some in praise of dulcinea but when he was 
found there afterwards the only ones completely legible that could be discovered were 
those that follow here ye on the mountain side that grow ye green things all trees shrubs 
and bushes are ye aweary of the woe that this poor aching bosom crushes if it disturb you 
and i owe some reparation it may be a defence for me to let you know don quixotes tears are 
on the flow and all for distant dulcinea del toboso adventureseeking doth he go up rugged 
heights down rocky valleys but hill or dale or high or low mishap attendeth all his sallies 
love still pursues him to and fro and plies his cruel scourgeah me a relentless fate an 
endless woe don quixotes tears are on the flow and all for distant dulcinea del toboso 
the addition of del toboso to dulcineas name gave rise to no little laughter among those 
who found the above lines for they suspected don quixote must have fancied that unless 
he added del toboso when he introduced the name of dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible 
which was indeed the fact as he himself afterwards admitted he wrote many more but as has 
been said these three verses were all that could be plainly and perfectly deciphered 
in this way and in sighing and calling on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs 
of the streams and echo moist and mournful to answer console and hear him as well as in looking 
for herbs to sustain him he passed his time until sanchos return and had that been delayed 
three weeks as it was three days the knight of the rueful countenance thou needst not doubt 
it sancho replied don quixote for in the same manner and by the same steps as i have described 
here knightserrant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors all we want now is to find 
out what king christian or pagan is at war and has a beautiful daughter and that i have won 
incredible fame throughout the universe i know not how it can be made out that i am of royal 
lineage or even second cousin to an emperor for the king will not be willing to give me his

to the five hundred sueldos mulct and it may be that the sage who shall write my history 
will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that i may find myself fifth or sixth in descent 
from a king for i would have thee know sancho that wounds caused by any instruments which 
happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity and this is laid down in the law of the 
duel in express words if for instance the cobbler strikes another with the last which 
he has in his hand though it be in fact a piece of wood it cannot be said for that reason that 
he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled i say this lest thou shouldst imagine that 
because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity 
for the arms those men carried with which they pounded us were nothing more than their 
stakes and not one of them so far as i remember carried rapier sword or dagger they gave 
me no time to see that much answered sancho for hardly had i laid hand on my tizona when they 
signed the cross on your worships grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught 
that made me vomit my bowels up it does not grieve me much to have lost it said don quixote 
for thou knowest sancho that i have the receipt in my memory so have i answered sancho but 
if ever i make it or try it again as long as i live may this be my last hour moreover i have no 
intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it for i mean with all my five senses to 
keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone as to being blanketed again i say 
nothing for it is hard to prevent mishaps of that sort and if they come there is nothing 
for it but to commend ourselves to god and let fortune take what course it will god guide 
it according to my wishes and thy wants said don quixote and mean be he who thinks himself 
mean in gods name let him be so said sancho i am an old christian and to fit me for a count thats 
enough and more than enough for thee said don quixote and even wert thou not it would make 
no difference because i being the king can easily give thee nobility without purchase 
or service rendered by thee for when i make thee a count then thou art at once a gentleman 
and they may say what they will but by my faith they will have to call thee your lordship 
whether they like it or not not a doubt of it and ill know how to support the tittle said sancho 
title thou shouldst say not tittle said his master so be it answered sancho i say i will 
know how to behave for once in my life i was beadle of a brotherhood and the beadles gown 
sat so well on me that all said i looked as if i was to be steward of the same brotherhood what 
will it be then when i put a dukes robe on my back or dress myself in gold and pearls like a 
count i believe theyll come a hundred leagues to see me thou wilt look well said don quixote 
but thou must shave thy beard often for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt that 
if thou dost not shave it every second day at least they will see what thou art at the distance 
of a musket shot what more will it be said sancho than having a barber and keeping him at 
wages in the house and even if it be necessary i will make him go behind me like a noblemans 
equerry why how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them asked don quixote 
i will tell you answered sancho it was because i have been looking at you for some time by 
the light of the torch held by that unfortunate and verily your worship has got of late 
the most illfavoured countenance i ever saw it must be either owing to the fatigue of this 
combat or else to the want of teeth and grinders it is not that replied don quixote but because 
the sage whose duty it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought 
it proper that i should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore did one being 
he of the burning sword another he of the unicorn this one he of the damsels that he of the 
phoenix another the knight of the griffin and another he of the death and by these names 
and designations they were known all the world round and so i say that the sage aforesaid 
must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to call me the knight of the rueful countenance 
into the signature i declare your worship is indeed the very devil and there is nothing 
you dont know everything is needed for the calling i follow said don quixote now then said 
sancho let your worship put the order for the three asscolts for which sancho thanked 
him while the two had been going along conversing in this fashion the curate observed 
to dorothea that she had shown great cleverness as well in the story itself as in its conciseness 
and the resemblance it bore to those of the books of chivalry she said that she had many 
times amused herself reading them but that she did not know the situation of the provinces 
or seaports and so she had said at haphazard that she had landed at osuna so i saw said the 
curate and for that reason i made haste to say what i did by which it was all set right but 
is it not a strange thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these 
figments and lies simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities of 
his books so it is said cardenio and so uncommon and unexampled that were one to attempt 
to invent and concoct it in fiction i doubt if there be any wit keen enough to imagine it 
but another strange thing about it said the curate is that apart from the silly things 
which this worthy gentleman says in connection with his craze when other subjects are 
dealt with he can discuss them in a perfectly rational manner showing that his mind is 
quite clear and composed so that provided his chivalry is not touched upon no one would 
take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound understanding while they were holding 
this conversation don quixote continued his with sancho saying friend panza let us forgive 
and forget as to our quarrels and tell me now dismissing anger and irritation where how 
and when didst thou find dulcinea what was she doing what didst thou say to her what did 
she answer how did she look when she was reading my letter who copied it out for thee and 
everything in the matter that seems to thee worth knowing asking and learning neither 
adding nor falsifying to give me pleasure nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive 
me of it senor replied sancho if the truth is to be told the soldier who executes what his 
captain orders does no less than the captain himself who gives the order my meaning is 
that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to heaven for the welfare of the world but we soldiers 
and knights carry into effect what they pray for defending it with the might of our arms 
and the edge of our swords not under shelter but in the open air a target for the intolerable 
rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter thus are we gods ministers on 
earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein and as the business of war and all 
that relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great sweat toil 
and exertion it follows that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more 
labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to god to help 
the weak i do not mean to say nor does it enter into my thoughts that the knighterrants calling 
is as good as that of poetry and even a finger or two above it i do not know what science that 
is said don lorenzo and until now i have never heard of it it is a science said don quixote 
that comprehends in itself all or most of the sciences in the world for he who professes 
it must be a jurist and must know the rules of justice distributive and equitable so as 
to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him he must be a theologian so as to be 
able to flog him with them and began to untie the points the common belief is he had but one 
in front by which his breeches were held up but the instant he approached him sancho woke 
up in his full senses and cried out what is this who is touching me and untrussing me it is 
i said don quixote and i come to make good thy shortcomings and relieve my own distresses 
i come to whip thee sancho and wipe off some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken dulcinea 
is perishing thou art living on regardless i am dying of hope deferred therefore untruss 
thyself with a good will for mine it is here in this retired spot to give thee at least two 
thousand lashes not a bit of it said sancho let your worship keep quiet or else by the living 
god the deaf shall hear us the lashes i pledged myself to must be voluntary and not forced 
upon me and just now i have no fancy to whip myself it is enough if i give you my word to flog 
and flap myself when i have a mind it will not do to leave it to thy courtesy sancho said don 
quixote for thou art hard of heart and though a clown tender of flesh and at the same time 
he strove and struggled to untie him seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master 
he gripped him with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched him 
on the ground on his back and pressing his right knee on his chest held his hands in his own 
so that he could neither move nor breathe how now traitor exclaimed don quixote dost thou 
revolt against thy master and natural lord dost thou rise against him who gives thee his 
bread i neither put down king nor set up king said sancho i only stand up for myself who am 
my own lord if your worship promises me to be quiet and not to offer to whip me now ill let 
you go free and unhindered if not traitor and dona sanchas foe thou diest on the spot don 
quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair 
of his garments and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself 
whenever he pleased sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about 
to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head and putting 
up his hands encountered somebodys two feet with shoes and stockings on them he trembled 
with fear and made for another tree where the very same thing happened to him and he fell 
ashouting calling upon don quixote to come and protect him don quixote did so and asked 
him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of sancho replied that all the trees 
were full of mens feet and legs don quixote felt them and guessed at once what it was and 
said to sancho thou hast nothing to be afraid of for these feet and legs that thou feelest 
but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that have been hanged 
on these trees for the authorities in these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and 
thirties when they catch them whereby i conjecture that i must be near barcelona and it 
was in fact as he supposed with the first light they looked up and saw that the fruit hanging 
on those trees were freebooters bodies and now day dawned and if the dead freebooters 
had scared them their hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones who 
all of a sudden surrounded them and in the catalan tongue bade them stand and wait until 
their captain came up don quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning 
against a tree and in short completely defenceless he thought it best therefore to fold 
his arms and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity 
the robbers made haste to search dapple and did not leave him a single thing of all he carried 
in the alforjas and in the valise and lucky it was for sancho that the dukes crowns and those 
he brought from home were in a girdle that he wore round him but for all that these good folk 
would have stripped him and even looked to see what he had hidden between the skin and flesh 
but for the arrival at that moment of their captain who was about thirtyfour years of age 
apparently strongly built above the middle height of stern aspect and swarthy complexion 
he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they 
call petronels in that country at his waist he saw that his squires for so they call those 
who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and 
was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped he wondered to see the lance leaning against the 
tree the shield on the ground and don quixote in armour and dejected with the saddest and 
most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce and going up to him he said be not 
so cast down good man for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman busiris but into 
roque guinarts which are more merciful than cruel the cause of my dejection returned 
don quixote is not that i have fallen into thy hands o valiant roque whose fame is bounded 
by no limits on earth but that my carelessness should have been so great that thy soldiers 
should have caught me unbridled when it is my duty according to the rule of knighterrantry 
which i profess to be always on the alert and at all times my own sentinel for let me tell 
thee great roque had they found me on my horse with my lance and shield it would not have 
been very easy for them to reduce me to submission for i am don quixote of la mancha otherwise 
called the knight of the lions for whom by the disposition of heaven above it is reserved 
to give a happy issue to this adventure and so saying he drew his sword and began making 
passes in the air at the millers who hearing but not understanding all this nonsense strove 
to stop the boat which was now getting into the rushing channel of the wheels sancho fell 
upon his knees devoutly appealing to heaven to deliver him from such imminent peril which 
it did by the activity and quickness of the millers who pushing against the boat with their 
poles stopped it not however without upsetting and throwing don quixote and sancho into 
the water and lucky it was for don quixote that he could swim like a goose though the weight 
of his armour carried him twice to the bottom and had it not been for the extraordinary 
fancies of don quixote and his conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor senor 
bachelor would have been incapacitated for ever from taking his degree of licentiate 
all through not finding nests where he thought to find birds tom cecial seeing how ill 
they had succeeded and what a sorry end their expedition had come to said to the bachelor 
sure enough senor samson carrasco we are served right it is easy enough to plan and set 
about an enterprise but it is often a difficult matter to come well out of it don quixote 
a madman and we sane he goes off laughing safe and sound and you are left sore and sorry id 
like to know now which is the madder he who is so because he cannot help it or he who is so of 
his own choice to which samson replied the difference between the two sorts of madmen 
is that he who is so will he nil he will be one always while he who is so of his own accord can 
leave off being one whenever he likes in that case said tom cecial i was a madman of my own 
accord when i volunteered to become your squire and of my own accord ill leave off being 
one and go home thats your affair returned samson but to suppose that i am going to travel 
on foot and make long ones is to suppose nonsense thou sayest well sancho said don quixote 
but remember all times are not alike nor are people always in good humour im now ready to 
burst with grief at seeing my green coat torn and they come to ask me to whip myself of my 
own free will i fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness not considering the 
irresistible influence he brought to bear upon me let not that trouble you my lady said 
leonela for it does not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious 
to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized nay they are wont 
to say that he who gives quickly gives twice they say also said camilla that what costs 
little is valued less that saying does not hold good in your case replied leonela for love 
as i have heard say sometimes flies and sometimes walks with this one it runs with that 
it moves slowly some it cools others it burns some it wounds others it slays it begins the 
course of its desires and at the same moment completes and ends it in the morning it will 
lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it for there is no power that can resist 
it so what are you in dread of what do you fear when the same must have befallen lothario 
love having chosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you and it was 
absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved upon without affording 
the time to let anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be left unfinished 
for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs than opportunity and of opportunity 
he avails himself in all his feats especially at the outset all this i know well myself 
more by experience than by hearsay and some day senora i will enlighten you on the subject 
for i am of your flesh and blood too moreover lady camilla you did not surrender yourself 
or yield so quickly but that first you saw lotharios whole soul in his eyes in his sighs 
in his words his promises and his gifts and by it and his good qualities perceived how worthy 
he was of your love this then being the case let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas 
trouble your imagination but be assured that lothario prizes you as you do him and rest 
content and satisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth and merit 
that has taken you and one that has not only the four ss that they say true lovers ought to 
have but a complete alphabet only listen to me and you will see how in the opening and shutting 
of an eye i sweep away all your difficulties and supply all those deficiencies which you 
say check and discourage you from bringing before the world the story of your famous don 
quixote the light and mirror of all knighterrantry say on said i listening to his talk 
how do you propose to make up for my diffidence and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity 
i am in to which he made answer your first difficulty about the sonnets epigrams or complimentary 
verses which you want for the beginning and which ought to be by persons of importance 
and rank can be removed if you yourself take a little trouble to make them you can afterwards 
baptise them and put any name you like to them fathering them on prester john of the indies 
or the emperor of trebizond who to my knowledge were said to have been famous poets and 
even if they were not and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the fact 
never care two maravedis for that for even if they prove a lie against you they cannot cut 
off the hand you wrote it with as to references in the margin to the books and authors from 
whom you take the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story it is only contriving to 
fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of latin you may happen to have by heart or at any rate 
that will not give you much trouble to look up so as when you speak of freedom and captivity 
to insert non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro and then refer in the margin to horace 
or whoever said it or if you allude to the power of death to come in with pallida mors aequo 
pulsat pede pauperum tabernas regumque turres if it be friendship and the love god bids 
us bear to our enemy go at once to the holy scriptures which you can do with a very small amount 
of research and quote no less than the words of god himself ego autem dico vobis diligite 
inimicos vestros if you speak of evil thoughts turn to the gospel de corde exeunt cogitationes 
malae if of the fickleness of friends there is cato who will give you his distich donec 
eris felix multos numerabis amicos tempora si fuerint nubila solus eris with these and 
such like bits of latin they will take you for a grammarian at all events and that nowadays 
is no small honour and profit with regard to adding annotations at the end of the book now 
let us come to those references to authors which other books have and you want for yours 
the remedy for this is very simple you have only to look out for some book that quotes them 
all from a to z as you say yourself and then insert the very same alphabet in your book and 
though the imposition may be plain to see because you have so little need to borrow from 
them that is no matter there will probably be some simple enough to believe that you have 
made use of them all in this plain artless story of yours at any rate if it answers no other 
purpose this long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of authority 
to your book besides no one will trouble himself to verify whether you have followed them 
or whether you have not being no way concerned in it especially as if i mistake not this 
book of yours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants for it is from beginning 
to end an attack upon the books of chivalry of which aristotle never dreamt nor st basil 
said a word nor cicero had any knowledge nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations 
of astrology come within the range of its fanciful vagaries nor have geometrical measurements 
or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to do with it nor does it mean 
to preach to anybody mixing up things human and divine a sort of motley in which no christian 
understanding should dress itself it has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its 
composition and the more perfect the imitation the better the work will be and as this 
piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the authority and influence which 
books of chivalry have in the world and with the public there is no need for you to go abegging 
for aphorisms from philosophers precepts from holy scripture fables from poets speeches 
from orators or miracles from saints but merely to take care that your style and diction 
run musically pleasantly and plainly with clear proper and wellplaced words setting 
forth your purpose to the best of your power and putting your ideas intelligibly without 
confusion or obscurity strive too that in reading your story the melancholy may be moved 
to laughter and the merry made merrier still that the simple shall not be wearied that 
the judicious shall admire the invention that the grave shall not despise it nor the wise 
fail to praise it finally keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that illfounded edifice 
of the books of chivalry hated by some and praised by many more for if you succeed in this 
you will have achieved no small success in profound silence i listened to what my friend 
said and his observations made such an impression on me that without attempting to question 
them i admitted their soundness and out of them i determined to make this preface wherein 
gentle reader thou wilt perceive my friends good sense my good fortune in finding such 
an adviser in such a time of need and what thou hast gained in receiving without addition 
or alteration the story of the famous don quixote of la mancha the undoer of injustice 
the righter of wrongs the protector of damsels the terror of giants and the winner of battles 
that said the goatherd sounds like what one reads in the books of the knightserrant who 
did all that you say this man does though it is my belief that either you are joking or else 
this gentleman has empty lodgings in his head you are a great scoundrel said don quixote 
and it is you who are empty and a fool i am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore 
you and passing from words to deeds he caught up a loaf that was near him and sent it full 
in the goatherds face with such force that he flattened his nose but the goatherd who did 
not understand jokes and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest paying no 
respect to carpet tablecloth or diners sprang upon don quixote and seizing him by the 
throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him had not sancho panza that instant 
come to the rescue and grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table smashing 
plates breaking glasses and upsetting and scattering everything on it don quixote finding 
himself free strove to get on top of the goatherd who with his face covered with blood and 
soundly kicked by sancho was on all fours feeling about for one of the tableknives to take 
a bloody revenge with the canon and the curate however prevented him but the barber so 
contrived it that he got don quixote under him and rained down upon him such a shower of 
fisticuffs that the poor knights face streamed with blood as freely as his own the canon 
and the curate were bursting with laughter the officers were capering with delight and 
both the one and the other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in 
a fight sancho alone was frantic for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of the 
canons servants who kept him from going to his masters assistance at last while they were 
all with the exception of the two bruisers who were mauling each other in high glee and 
enjoyment they heard a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the 
direction whence the sound seemed to come but the one that was most excited by hearing 
it was don quixote who though sorely against his will he was under the goatherd and something 
more than pretty well pummelled said to him brother devil for it is impossible but that 
thou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine i ask thee 
to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our 
ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure the goatherd who was by this time tired 
of pummelling and being pummelled released him at once and don quixote rising to his feet 
and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard suddenly saw coming 
down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents the fact was that the clouds 
had that year withheld their moisture from the earth and in all the villages of the district 
they were organising processions rogations and penances imploring god to open the hands 
of his mercy and send the rain and to this end the people of a village that was hard by were 
going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one side of that valley don quixote 
when he saw the strange garb of the penitents without reflecting how often he had seen 
it before took it into his head that he was sane and in his full senses and under this impression 
wrote to the archbishop entreating him earnestly and in very correct language to have 
him released from the misery in which he was living for by gods mercy he had now recovered 
his lost reason though his relations in order to enjoy his property kept him there and 
in spite of the truth would make him out to be mad until his dying day the archbishop moved 
by repeated sensible wellwritten letters directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry 
of the madhouse as to the truth of the licentiates statements and to have an interview 
with the madman himself and if it should appear that he was in his senses to take him out 
and restore him to liberty the chaplain did so and the governor assured him that the man 
was still mad and that though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person he would 
in the end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced all the 
sensible things he had said before as might be easily tested by talking to him the chaplain 
resolved to try the experiment and obtaining access to the madman conversed with him 
for an hour or more during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that was incoherent 
or absurd but on the contrary spoke so rationally that the chaplain was compelled to believe 
him to be sane among other things he said the governor was against him not to lose the presents 
his relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals and that the 
worst foe he had in his misfortune was his large property for in order to enjoy it his enemies 
disparaged and threw doubts upon the mercy our lord had shown him in turning him from a 
brute beast into a man in short he spoke in such a way as to make it seem thou art listening 
to thyself for all affectation is bad dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still for 
the health of the whole body is forged in the workshop of the stomach be temperate in drinking 
bearing in mind that wine in excess keeps neither secrets nor promises take care sancho 
not to chew on both sides and not to eruct in anybodys presence eruct said sancho i dont 
know what that means to eruct sancho said don quixote means to belch and that is one of the 
filthiest words in the spanish language though a very expressive one and therefore nice 
folk have had recourse to the latin and instead of belch say eruct and instead of belches 
say eructations and if some do not understand these terms it matters little for custom 
will bring them into use in the course of time so that they will be readily understood this 
is the way a language is enriched custom and the public are allpowerful there in truth 
senor said sancho one of the counsels and cautions i mean to bear in mind shall be this not 
to belch for im constantly doing it eruct sancho not belch said don quixote eruct i shall 
say henceforth and i swear not to forget it said sancho likewise sancho said don quixote 
thou must not mingle such a quantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost for though 
proverbs are short maxims thou dost drag them in so often by the head and shoulders that 
they savour more of nonsense than of maxims god alone can cure that said sancho for i have 
more proverbs in me than a book and when i speak they come so thick together into my mouth 
that they fall to fighting among themselves to get out thats why my tongue lets fly the 
first that come though they may not be pat to the purpose but ill take care henceforward 
to use such as befit the dignity of my office for in a house where theres plenty supper is 
soon cooked i mean theres no need of telling or warning me about anything for im ready for 
everything and know a little of everything that i believe sancho said don quixote go and 
good luck to thee and god speed thee sancho went off at top speed forcing dapple out of his 
regular pace and came to where the fair huntress was standing and dismounting knelt before 
her and said fair lady that knight that you see there the knight of the lions by name is my 
master and i am a squire of his and at home they call me sancho panza this same knight of the 
lions who was called not long since the knight of the rueful countenance it gave them no 
little amusement both of them to see what a good memory sancho had and they complimented 
him greatly upon it and begged him to repeat the letter a couple of times more so that they 
too might get it by heart to write it out byandby sancho repeated it three times and as he 
did uttered three thousand more absurdities then he told them more about his master but 
he never said a word about the blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn into which 
he refused to enter he told them moreover how his lord if he brought him a favourable answer 
from the lady dulcinea del toboso was to put himself in the way of endeavouring to become 
an emperor or at least a monarch for it had been so settled between them and with his personal 
worth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come to be one and how on becoming one 
his lord was to make a marriage for him for he would be a widower by that time as a matter of 
course and was to give him as a wife one of the damsels of the empress the heiress of some 
rich and grand state on the mainland having nothing to do with islands of any sort for he 
did not care for them now all this sancho delivered with so much composurewiping his nose 
from time to timeand with so little commonsense that his two hearers were again filled 
with wonder at the force of don quixotes madness that could run away with this poor mans 
reason they did not care to take the trouble of disabusing him of his error as they considered 
that since it did not in any way hurt his conscience it would be better to leave him in it 
and they would have all the more amusement in listening to his simplicities and so they 
bade him pray to god for his lords health as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing 
for him in course of time to come to be an emperor as he said or at least an archbishop or some 
other dignitary of equal rank to which sancho made answer if fortune sirs should bring 
things about in such a way that my master should have a mind instead of being an emperor 
to be an archbishop i should like to know what archbishopserrant commonly give their 
squires they commonly give them said the curate some simple benefice or cure or some place 
as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income not counting the altar fees which may 
be reckoned at as much more but for that said sancho the squire must be unmarried and must 
know at any rate how to help at mass and if that be so woe is me for i am married already and 
i dont know the first letter of the a b c what will become of me if my master takes a fancy to 
be an archbishop for that is what im afraid of your worship would recommend him to marry 
this princess at once for in this way he will be disabled from taking archbishops orders 
and will easily come into his empire and i to the end of my desires i have been thinking over 
the matter carefully and by what i can make out i find it will not do for me that my master 
should become an archbishop because i am no good for the church as i am married and for me 
now having as i have a wife and children to support and bring up so let it be likewise a hint 
to your worship as it cannot be a mandate that on no account will i draw sword either against 
clown or against knight and that here before god i forgive the insults that have been offered 
me whether they have been are or shall be offered me by high or low rich or poor noble or commoner 
not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever to all which his master said in reply i 
wish i had breath enough to speak somewhat easily and that the pain i feel on this side would 
abate so as to let me explain to thee panza the mistake thou makest come now sinner suppose 
the wind of fortune hitherto so adverse should turn in our favour filling the sails of 
our desires so that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those 
islands i have promised thee how would it be with thee if on winning it i made thee lord of 
it why thou wilt make it wellnigh impossible through not being a knight nor having any 
desire to be one nor possessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy 
lordship for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds 
of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is 
no fear of their making some move to change matters once more and try as they say what chance 
may do for them so it is essential that the new possessor should have good sense to enable 
him to govern and valour to attack and defend himself whatever may befall him in what has 
now befallen us answered sancho id have been well pleased to have that good sense and that 
valour your worship speaks of but i swear on the faith of a poor man i am more fit for plasters 
than for arguments see if your worship can get up and let us help rocinante though he does 
not deserve it for he was the main cause of all this thrashing i never thought it of rocinante 
for i took him to be a virtuous person and as quiet as myself after all they say right that 
it takes a long time to come to know people and that there is nothing sure in this life who 
would have said that after such mighty slashes as your worship gave that unlucky knighterrant 
there was coming travelling post and at the very heels of them such a great storm of sticks 
as has fallen upon our shoulders and yet thine sancho replied don quixote ought to be used 
to such squalls but mine reared in soft cloth and fine linen it is plain they must feel more 
keenly the pain of this mishap and if it were not that i imaginewhy do i say imagineknow 
of a certainty that all these annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling 
of arms i would lay me down here to die of pure vexation to this the squire replied senor 
as these mishaps are what one reaps of chivalry tell me if they happen very often or if they 
have their own fixed times for coming to pass because it seems to me that for us to remain 
any longer in this castle now is useless and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall 
find out some day for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned by means of 
secret and diligent spies that i am going to destroy him and if the opportunity be given 
him he may seize it to fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold against 
which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little therefore 
lady let us as i say forestall his schemes by our activity and let us depart at once in quest 
of fair fortune for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire 
for you have before you your worthy brother and your good sisterinlaw he whom you see here 
is the captain viedma and this is the fair moor who has been so good to him the frenchmen 
i told you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may show the generosity 
of your kind heart the captain ran to embrace his brother who placed both hands on his breast 
so as to have a good look at him holding him a little way off but as soon as he had fully recognised 
him he clasped him in his arms so closely shedding such tears of heartfelt joy that most 
of those present could not but join in them the words the brothers exchanged the emotion 
they showed can scarcely be imagined i fancy much less put down in writing they told each 
other in a few words the events of their lives they showed the true affection of brothers 
in all its strength then the judge embraced zoraida putting all he possessed at her disposal 
then he made his daughter embrace her and the fair christian and the lovely moor drew fresh 
tears from every eye and there was don quixote observing all these strange proceedings 
attentively without uttering a word and attributing the whole to chimeras of knighterrantry 
then they agreed that the captain and zoraida should return with his brother to seville 
and send news to his father of his having been delivered and found so as to enable him to 
come and be present at the marriage and baptism of zoraida for it was impossible for the 
judge to put off his journey as he was informed that in a month from that time the fleet was 
to sail from seville for new spain and to miss the passage would have been a great inconvenience 
to him in short everybody was well pleased and glad at the captives good fortune and as 
now almost twothirds of the night were past they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder 
of it don quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be attacked by 
some giant or other malevolent scoundrel covetous of the great treasure of beauty the 
castle contained those who understood him returned him thanks for this service and they 
gave the judge an account of his extraordinary humour with which he was not a little amused 
sancho panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest and he of 
all was the one that made himself most comfortable as he stretched himself on the trappings 
of his ass which as will be told farther on cost him so dear the ladies then having retired 
to their chamber and the others having disposed themselves with as little discomfort 
as they could don quixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had 
promised it happened however that a little before the approach of dawn a voice so musical 
and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forced them all to listen attentively 
but especially dorothea who had been awake and by whose side dona clara de viedma for so 
the judges daughter was called lay sleeping no one could imagine who it was that sang so 
sweetly and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument at one moment it seemed to them 
as if the singer were in the courtyard at another in the stable and as they were all attention 
wondering cardenio came to the door and said listen whoever is not asleep and you will 
hear a muleteers voice that enchants as it chants we are listening to it already senor 
said dorothea on which cardenio went away and dorothea giving all her attention to it 
made out the words of the song to be these chapter xliii wherein is related the pleasant 
story of the muleteer together with other strange things that came to pass in the inn ah 
me loves mariner am i on loves deep ocean sailing i know not where the haven lies i dare not 
hope to gain it one solitary distant star is all i have to guide me a brighter orb than those 
of old that palinurus lighted and vaguely drifting am i borne i know not where it leads 
me i fix my gaze on it alone of all beside it heedless but overcautious prudery and coyness 
cold and cruel when most i need it these like clouds its longedfor light refuse me bright 
star goal of my yearning eyes as thou above me beamest when thou shalt hide thee from my 
sight ill know that death is near me the singer had got so far when it struck dorothea that 
it was not fair to let clara miss hearing such a sweet voice so shaking her from side to side 
she woke her saying forgive me child for waking thee but i do so that thou mayest have the 
pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard perhaps in all thy life clara awoke 
quite drowsy and not understanding at the moment what dorothea said asked her what it 
was she was going to say before on this clara afraid that luscinda might overhear her winding 
her arms tightly round dorothea put her mouth so close to her ear that she could speak without 
fear of being heard by anyone else and said this singer dear senora is the son of a gentleman 
of aragon lord of two villages who lives opposite my fathers house at madrid and though 
my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter and latticework in summer 
in some wayi know not howthis gentleman who was pursuing his studies saw me whether in 
church or elsewhere i cannot tell and in fact fell in love with me and gave me to know it from 
the windows of his house with so many signs and tears that i was forced to believe him and 
even to love him without knowing what it was he wanted of me one of the signs he used to make 
me was to link one hand in the other to show me he wished to marry me and though i should have 
been glad if that could be being alone and motherless i knew not whom to open my mind to and 
so i left it as it was showing him no favour except when my father and his too were from home 
to raise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly at which he would 
show such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad meanwhile the time for my fathers 
departure arrived which he became aware of but not from me for i had never been able to tell 
him of it he fell sick of grief i believe and so the day we were going away i could not see him 
to take farewell of him were it only with the eyes but after we had been two days on the road 
on entering the posada of a village a days journey from this i saw him at the inn door in the 
dress of a muleteer and so well disguised that if i did not carry his image graven on my heart 
it would have been impossible for me to recognise him but i knew him and i was surprised 
and glad he watched me unsuspected by my father from whom he always hides himself when 
he crosses my path on the road or in the posadas where we halt and as i know what he is and reflect 
that for love of me he makes this journey on foot in all this hardship i am ready to die of 
sorrow and where he sets foot there i set my eyes i know not with what object he has come or 
how he could have got away from his father who loves him beyond measure having no other 
heir and because he deserves it as you will perceive when you see him and moreover i can 
tell you all that he sings is out of his own head for i have heard them say he is a great scholar 
and poet and what is more every time i see him or hear him sing i tremble all over and am terrified 
lest my father should recognise him and come to know of our loves i have never spoken a word 
to him in my life and for all that i love him so that i could not live without him this dear 
senora is all i have to tell you about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much 
and from it alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer but a lord of hearts and towns 
as i told you already say no more dona clara said dorothea at this at the same time kissing 
her a thousand times over say no more i tell you but wait till day comes when i trust in god 
to arrange this affair of yours so that it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning 
deserves ah senora said dona clara what end can be hoped for when his father is of such lofty 
position and so wealthy that he would think i was not fit to be even a servant to his son much 
less wife and as to marrying without the knowledge of my father i would not do it for all 
the world i would not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and leave me 
perhaps with not seeing him and the long distance we shall have to travel the pain i suffer 
now may become easier though i daresay the remedy i propose will do me very little good 
i dont know how the devil this has come about or how this love i have for him got in i such a 
young girl and he such a mere boy for i verily believe we are both of an age and i am not sixteen 
yet for i will be sixteen michaelmas day next my father says dorothea could not help laughing 
to hear how like a child dona clara spoke let us go to sleep now senora said she for the little 
of the night that i fancy is left to us god will soon send us daylight and we will set all to 
rights or it will go hard with me with this they fell asleep and deep silence reigned all 
through the inn the only persons not asleep were the landladys daughter and her servant 
maritornes who knowing the weak point of don quixotes humour and that he was outside the 
inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback resolved the pair of them to play some trick 
upon him or at any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense as it 
so happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards except a hole in 
the wall of a strawloft through which they used to throw out the straw at this hole the two 
demidamsels posted themselves and observed don quixote on his horse leaning on his pike 
and from time to time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs that he seemed to pluck 
up from the depths of his bowels but they all thought it must be from the pain he felt in his 
ribs at any rate they who had seen him plastered the night before thought so as soon as they 
were both mounted at the gate of the inn exclaimed here comes a fine troop of guests if they 
stop here we may say gaudeamus what are they said cardenio four men said the landlord riding 
a la jineta with lances and bucklers and all with black veils and with them there is a woman 
in white on a sidesaddle whose face is also veiled and two attendants on foot are they very 
near said the curate so near answered the landlord that here they come hearing this dorothea 
covered her face and cardenio retreated into don quixotes room and they hardly had time 
to do so before the whole party the host had described entered the inn and the four that 
were on horseback who were of highbred appearance and bearing dismounted and came forward 
to take down the woman who rode on the sidesaddle and one of them taking her in his arms placed 
her in a chair that stood at the entrance of the room where cardenio had hidden himself 
all this time neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word only on sitting 
down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let her arms fall like one that was ill and 
weak the attendants on foot then led the horses away to the stable observing this the curate 
curious to know who these people in such a dress and preserving such silence were went 
to where the servants were standing and put the question to one of them who answered him 
faith sir i cannot tell you who they are i only know they seem to be people of distinction 
particularly he who advanced to take the lady you saw in his arms and i say so because all 
the rest show him respect and nothing is done except what he directs and orders and the 
lady who is she asked the curate that i cannot tell you either said the servant for i have 
not seen her face all the way i have indeed heard her sigh many times and utter such groans 
that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time but it is no wonder if we do not know more 
than we have told you as my comrade and i have only been in their company two days for having 
met us on the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to andalusia promising 
to pay us well and have you heard any of them called by his name asked the curate no indeed 
replied the servant they all preserve a marvellous silence on the road for not a sound 
is to be heard among them except the poor ladys sighs and sobs which make us pity her and 
we feel sure that wherever it is she is going it is against her will and as far as one can judge 
from her dress she is a nun or what is more likely about to become one and perhaps it is because 
taking the vows is not of her own free will that she is so unhappy as she seems to be that may 
well be said the young girl for it has many a time happened to me to dream that i was falling 
down from a tower and never coming to the ground and when i awoke from the dream to find myself 
as weak and shaken as if i had really fallen there is the point senora replied sancho panza 
that i without dreaming at all but being more awake than i am now find myself with scarcely 
less wheals than my master don quixote how is the gentleman called asked maritornes the 
asturian don quixote of la mancha answered sancho panza and he is a knightadventurer 
and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world this long time past what 
is a knightadventurer said the lass are you so new in the world as not to know answered sancho 
panza well then you must know sister that a knightadventurer is a thing that in two words 
is seen drubbed and emperor that is today the most miserable and needy being in the world 
and tomorrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire then how is it 
said the hostess that belonging to so good a master as this you have not to judge by appearances 
even so much as a county it is too soon yet answered sancho for we have only been a month going 
in quest of adventures and so far we have met with nothing that can be called one for it will 
happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found however if my master don 
quixote gets well of this wound or fall and i am left none the worse of it i would not change 
my hopes for the best title in spain to all this conversation don quixote was listening 
very attentively and sitting up in bed as well as he could and begged his master to give 
him his sword saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly pigs for he 
had by this time found out that that was what they were let them be my friend said don quixote 
this insult is the penalty of my sin and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that 
jackals should devour a vanquished knight and wasps sting him and pigs trample him under 
foot i suppose it is the chastisement of heaven too said sancho that flies should prick 
the squires of vanquished knights and lice eat them and hunger assail them if we squires 
were the sons of the knights we serve or their very near relations it would be no wonder 
if you did for my deeds do not argue anything else but for all that i would have you take notice 
that i am neither so mad nor so foolish as i must have seemed to you a gallant knight shows 
to advantage bringing his lance to bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his 
sovereign in the midst of a spacious plaza a knight shows to advantage arrayed in glittering 
armour pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous tournament and all those knights 
show to advantage that entertain divert and if we may say so honour the courts of their 
princes by warlike exercises or what resemble them but to greater advantage than all 
these does a knighterrant show when he traverses deserts solitudes crossroads forests 
and mountains in quest of perilous adventures bent on bringing them to a happy and successful 
issue all to win a glorious and lasting renown to greater advantage i maintain does the 
knighterrant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste than the court knight 
dallying with some city damsel all knights have their own special parts to play let the 
courtier devote himself to the ladies let him add lustre to his sovereigns court by his 
liveries let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table let him 
arrange joustings marshal tournaments and prove himself noble generous and magnificent 
and above all a good christian and so doing he will fulfil the duties that are especially 
his but let the knighterrant explore the corners of the earth and penetrate the most intricate 
labyrinths at each step let him attempt impossibilities on desolate heaths let him endure 
the burning rays of the midsummer sun and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds and 
frosts let no lions daunt him no monsters terrify him no dragons make him quail for to seek 
these to attack those and to vanquish all are in truth his main duties i then as it has fallen 
to my lot to be a member of knighterrantry cannot avoid attempting all that to me seems 
to come within the sphere of my duties thus it was my bounden duty to attack those lions 
that i just now attacked although i knew it to be the height of rashness for i know well what 
valour is that it is a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes cowardice 
and temerity but it will be a lesser evil for him who is valiant to rise till he reaches the 
point of rashness than to sink until he reaches the point of cowardice for as it is easier 
for the prodigal than for the miser to become generous so it is easier for a rash man to prove 
truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour and believe me senor don diego in 
attempting adventures it is better to lose by a card too many than by a card too few for to 
hear it said such a knight is rash and daring sounds better than such a knight is timid and 
cowardly i protest senor don quixote said the duchess that in all you say you go most cautiously 
and lead in hand as the saying is henceforth i will believe myself and i will take care that 
my altisidora employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort for she is extremely 
expert at it there is no occasion to have recourse to that remedy senora said altisidora 
for the mere thought of the cruelty with which thou hast treated me obdurate knight o harder 
thou than marble to my plaint or at least believed to be dead by all who saw me and had it not 
been that he stumbled and fell i should never have caught him what did you run for fellow 
said sancho to which the young man replied senor it was to avoid answering all the questions 
officers of justice put what are you by trade a weaver and what do you weave lance heads 
with your worships good leave youre facetious with me you plume yourself on being a wag 
very good and where were you going just now to take the air senor and where does one take 
the air in this island where it blows good your answers are very much to the point you are 
a smart youth but take notice that i am the air and that i blow upon you astern and send you 
to gaol ho there lay hold of him and take him off ill make him sleep there tonight without 
air by god said the young man your worship will make me sleep in gaol just as soon as make 
me king why shant i make thee sleep in gaol said sancho have i not the power to arrest thee 
and release thee whenever i like all the power your worship has said the young man wont 
be able to make me sleep if i dont choose no truly said the secretary and the fellow has made 
his point so then said sancho it would be entirely of your own choice you would keep from 
sleeping not in opposition to my will no senor said the youth certainly not well then go 
and god be with you said sancho be off home to sleep and god give you sound sleep for i dont 
want to rob you of it but for the future let me advise you dont joke with the authorities 
because you may come across some one who will bring down the joke on your own skull the young 
man went his way and the governor continued his round and shortly afterwards two tipstaffs 
came up with a man in custody and said senor governor this person who seems to be a man is 
not so but a woman and not an illfavoured one in mans clothes they raised two or three lanterns 
to her face and by their light they distinguished the features of a woman to all appearance 
of the age of sixteen or a little more with her hair gathered into a gold and green silk net 
and fair as a thousand pearls they scanned her from head to foot and observed that she had 
on red silk stockings with garters of white taffety bordered with gold and pearl her breeches 
were of green and gold stuff and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore a doublet 
of the finest white and gold cloth her shoes were white and such as men wear she carried 
no sword at her belt but only a richly ornamented dagger and on her fingers she had several 
handsome rings in short the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all and none of those 
who beheld her knew her the people of the town said they could not imagine who she was and 
those who were in the secret of the jokes that were to be practised upon sancho were the 
ones who were most surprised for this incident or discovery had not been arranged by them 
and they watched anxiously to see how the affair would end sancho was fascinated by the 
girls beauty and he asked her who she was where she was going and what had induced her to 
dress herself in that garb she with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest confusion 
i cannot tell you senor before so many people what it is of such consequence to me to have 
kept secret one thing i wish to be known that i am no thief or evildoer but only an unhappy 
maiden whom the power of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due to modesty 
hearing this the majordomo said to sancho make the people stand back senor governor that 
this lady may say what she wishes with less embarrassment sancho gave the order and all 
except the majordomo the headcarver and the secretary fell back finding herself then 
in the presence of no more the damsel went on to say i am the daughter sirs of pedro perez 
mazorca the woolfarmer of this town who is in the habit of coming very often to my fathers 
house that wont do senora said the majordomo for i know diego de la llana and know that he 
is a gentleman of position and a rich man and that he has a son and a daughter and that since 
he was left a widower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his daughters face 
for he keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a chance of seeing her 
and for all that report says she is extremely beautiful it is true said the damsel and i 
am that daughter whether report lies or not as to my beauty you sirs will have decided by 
this time as you have seen me and with this she began to weep in earnest as if she already 
saw sanchica dead and buried sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her 
a countess he would put it off as long as possible here their conversation came to an end 
and don quixote retired to take his midday sleep but the duchess begged sancho unless 
he had a very great desire to go to sleep to come and spend the afternoon with her and her 
damsels in a very cool chamber sancho replied that though he certainly had the habit of 
sleeping four or five hours in the heat of the day in summer to serve her excellence he would 
try with all his might not to sleep even one that day and that he would come in obedience 
to her command and with that he went off the duke gave fresh orders with respect to treating 
don quixote as a knighterrant without departing even in smallest particular from the 
style in which as the stories tell us they used to treat the knights of old chapter xxxiii 
of the delectable discourse which the duchess and her damsels held with sancho panza 
well worth reading and noting chapter xxxiv which relates how they learned the way in 
which they were to disenchant the peerless dulcinea del toboso which is one of the rarest 
adventures in this book chapter xxxv wherein is continued the instruction given to don 
quixote touching the disenchantment of dulcinea together with other marvellous incidents 
chapter xxxvi wherein is related the strange and undreamtof adventure of the distressed 
duenna alias the countess trifaldi together with a letter which sancho panza wrote to 
his wife teresa panza chapter xxxvii wherein is continued the notable adventure of the 
distressed duenna chapter xxxviii wherein is told the distressed duennas tale of her 
misfortunes chapter xxxix in which the trifaldi continues her marvellous and memorable 
story chapter xl of matters relating and belonging to this adventure and to this memorable 
history chapter xli of the arrival of clavileno and the end of this protracted adventure 
chapter xlii of the counsels which don quixote gave sancho panza before he set out to govern 
the island together with other wellconsidered matters the duke and duchess were so well 
pleased with the successful and droll result of the adventure of the distressed duenna 
which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not only for the time being but for all 
their lives and sancho something to talk about for ages if he lived so long but don quixote 
coming close to his ear said to him sancho as you would have us believe what you saw in heaven 
i require you to believe me as to what i saw in the cave of montesinos where he says he saw 
the lady dulcinea del toboso in the very same dress and apparel that i said i had seen her 
in when i enchanted her all to please myself it must be all exactly the other way as your 
ladyship says because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a cunning 
trick could be concocted in a moment nor do i think my master is so mad that by my weak and 
feeble persuasion he could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason but senora your 
excellence must not therefore think me illdisposed for a dolt like me is not bound to see 
into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters i invented all that to escape my masters 
scolding and not with any intention of hurting him and if it has turned out differently 
there is a god in heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or reward the good and it 
is not fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to others they 
being therein no way concerned this request i make thus gently and quietly that if you 
comply with it i may have reason for thanking you and if you will not voluntarily this lance 
and sword together with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by force nice 
nonsense said the commissary a fine piece of pleasantry he has come out with at last he 
wants us to let the kings prisoners go as if we had any authority to release them or he to 
order us to do so go your way sir and good luck to you put that basin straight that youve got 
on your head and dont go looking for three feet on a cat tis you that are the cat rat and rascal 
replied don quixote and acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving 
him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a lancethrust 
and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the musket the other guards stood thunderstruck 
and amazed at this unexpected event but recovering presence of mind those on horseback 
seized their swords and those on foot their javelins and attacked don quixote who was 
waiting for them with great calmness and no doubt it would have gone badly with him if the 
galley slaves seeing the chance before them of liberating themselves had not effected 
it by contriving to break the chain on which they were strung such was the confusion that 
the guards now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose now to attack don quixote 
who was waiting for them did nothing at all that was of any use sancho on his part gave a helping 
hand to release gines de pasamonte who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and 
unfettered and who attacking the prostrate commissary took from him his sword and the 
musket with which aiming at one and levelling at another he without ever discharging 
it drove every one of the guards off the field for they took to flight as well to escape pasamontes 
musket as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them 
sancho was greatly grieved at the affair because he anticipated that those who had fled 
would report the matter to the holy brotherhood who at the summons of the alarmbell would 
at once sally forth in quest of the offenders and he said so to his master and entreated 
him to leave the place at once and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by that is all 
very well said sancho but the order must needs be signed and if it is copied they will say 
the signature is false and i shall be left without asscolts the order shall go signed in 
the same book said don quixote and on seeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying 
it as to the loveletter thou canst put by way of signature yours till death the knight of 
the rueful countenance by the life of my father said sancho when he heard the letter it 
is the loftiest thing i ever heard body of me how your worship says everything as you like 
in it and how well you fit in the knight of the rueful countenance more then than at any other 
time i will tell you answered sancho it was because i have been looking at you for some time 
by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate and verily your worship has got of late 
the most illfavoured countenance i ever saw it must be either owing to the fatigue of this 
combat or else to the want of teeth and grinders it is not that replied don quixote but because 
the sage whose duty it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought 
it proper that i should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore did one being 
he of the burning sword another he of the unicorn this one he of the damsels that he of the 
phoenix another the knight of the griffin and another he of the death and by these names 
and designations they were known all the world round and so i say that the sage aforesaid 
must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to call me the knight of the rueful countenance 
i asked her if that biscayan the other day had been there and she told me he had and that he 
was an honest fellow i asked her too about the galley slaves but she said she had not seen 
any as yet so far all goes well said don quixote but tell me senor bachelor what deeds of 
mine are they that are made most of in this history on that point replied the bachelor opinions 
differ as tastes do some swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took 
to be briareuses and giants others by that of the fulling mills one cries up the description 
of the two armies that afterwards took the appearance of two droves of sheep another that 
of the dead body on its way to be buried at segovia a third says the liberation of the galley 
slaves is the best of all and a fourth that nothing comes up to the affair with the benedictine 
giants and the battle with the valiant biscayan tell me senor bachelor said sancho at 
this point does the adventure with the yanguesans come in when our good rocinante went 
hankering after dainties the sage has left nothing in the inkbottle replied samson he 
tells all and sets down everything even to the capers that worthy sancho cut in the blanket 
i cut no capers in the blanket returned sancho in the air i did and more of them than i liked 
there is no human history in the world i suppose said don quixote that has not its ups and 
downs but more than others such as deal with chivalry for they can never be entirely made 
up of prosperous adventures for all that replied the bachelor there are those who have 
read the history who say they would have been glad if the author had left out some of the 
countless cudgellings that were inflicted on senor don quixote in various encounters 
thats where the truth of the history comes in said sancho at the same time they might fairly 
have passed them over in silence observed don quixote for there is no need of recording 
events which do not change or affect the truth of a history if they tend to bring the hero 
of it into contempt aeneas was not in truth and earnest so pious as virgil represents him 
nor ulysses so wise as homer describes him that is true said samson but it is one thing to 
write as a poet another to write as a historian the poet may describe or sing things not 
as they were but as they ought to have been but the historian has to write them down not as 
they ought to have been but as they were without adding anything to the truth or taking 
anything from it well then said sancho if this senor moor goes in for telling the truth 
no doubt among my masters drubbings mine are to be found for they never took the measure 
of his worships shoulders without doing the same for my whole body but i have no right to 
wonder at that for as my master himself says the members must share the pain of the head 
you are a sly dog sancho said don quixote i faith you have no want of memory when you choose 
to remember if i were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me said sancho my weals would 
not let me for they are still fresh on my ribs hush sancho said don quixote and dont mind 
any other for thou knowest nothing about colures lines parallels zodiacs ecliptics 
poles solstices equinoxes planets signs bearings the measures of which the celestial 
and terrestrial spheres are composed if thou wert acquainted with all these things or 
any portion of them thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we have cut what signs 
we have seen and what constellations we have left behind and are now leaving behind but 
again i tell thee feel and hunt for i am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white 
paper sancho felt and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollow of his left 
knee he looked up at his master and said either the test is a false one or we have not come 
to where your worship says nor within many leagues of it why how so asked don quixote hast 
thou come upon aught ay and aughts replied sancho and shaking his fingers he washed his 
whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in midstream not moved 
by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter but simply by the current just there 
smooth and gentle they now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle 
of the river and the instant don quixote saw them he cried out seest thou there my friend 
there stands the castle or fortress where there is no doubt some knight in durance or illused 
queen or infanta or princess in whose aid i am brought hither what the devil city fortress 
or castle is your worship talking about senor said sancho dont you see that those are mills 
that stand in the river to grind corn hold thy peace sancho said don quixote though they 
look like mills they are not so i have already told thee that enchantments transform things 
and change their proper shapes i do not mean to say they really change them from one form 
into another but that it seems as though they did as experience proved in the transformation 
of dulcinea sole refuge of my hopes by this time the boat having reached the middle of the 
stream began to move less slowly than hitherto the millers belonging to the mills when 
they saw the boat coming down the river and on the point of being sucked in by the draught 
of the wheels ran out in haste several of them with long poles to stop it and being all mealy 
with faces and garments covered with flour they presented a sinister appearance they 
raised loud shouts crying devils of men where are you going to are you mad do you want to 
drown yourselves or dash yourselves to pieces among these wheels did i not tell thee sancho 
said don quixote at once for i know not what i am so focile means so focile means i am so much 
that way replied sancho i understand thee still less now said don quixote well if you cant 
understand me said sancho i dont know how to put it i know no more god help me oh now i have 
hit it said don quixote thou wouldst say thou art so docile tractable and gentle that thou 
wilt take what i say to thee and submit to what i teach thee i would bet said sancho that from 
the very first you understood me and knew what i meant but you wanted to put me out that you 
might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders may be so replied don quixote but to 
come to the point what does teresa say teresa says replied sancho that i should make sure 
with your worship and let papers speak and beards be still for he who binds does not wrangle 
and the bellringers in a safe berth and giving and keeping require brains thats it sancho 
said don quixote pack tack string proverbs together nobody is hindering thee my mother 
beats me and i go on with my tricks i am bidding thee avoid proverbs and here in a second thou 
hast shot out a whole litany of them which have as much to do with what we are talking about 
as over the hills of ubeda mind sancho i do not say that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable 
but to pile up and string together proverbs at random makes conversation dull and vulgar 
when thou ridest on horseback do not go lolling with thy body on the back of the saddle nor 
carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from the horses belly nor yet sit so loosely that one 
would suppose thou wert on dapple for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and grooms 
of others be moderate in thy sleep for he who does not rise early does not get the benefit 
of the day and remember sancho diligence is the mother of good fortune and indolence its 
opposite never yet attained the object of an honest ambition the last counsel i will give 
thee now though it does not tend to bodily improvement i would have thee carry carefully 
in thy memory for i believe it will be no less useful to thee than those i have given thee 
already and it is thisnever engage in a dispute about families at least in the way of comparing 
them one with another for necessarily one of those compared will be better than the other 
and thou wilt be hated by the one thou hast disparaged and get nothing in any shape from 
the one thou hast exalted thy attire shall be hose of full length a long jerkin and a cloak 
a trifle longer loose breeches by no means for they are becoming neither for gentlemen 
nor for governors for the present sancho this is all that has occurred to me to advise thee 
as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shall follow if thou take care to let 
me know how thou art circumstanced senor said sancho i see well enough that all these things 
your worship has said to me are good holy and profitable but what use will they be to me if 
i dont remember one of them to be sure that about not letting my nails grow and marrying 
again if i have the chance will not slip out of my head but all that other hash muddle and 
jumblei dont and cant recollect any more of it than of last years clouds so it must be given 
me in writing for though i cant either read or write ill give it to my confessor to drive 
it into me and remind me of it whenever it is necessary ah sinner that i am said don quixote 
how bad it looks in governors not to know how to read or write for let me tell thee sancho 
when a man knows not how to read or is lefthanded it argues one of two things either that 
he was the son of exceedingly mean and lowly parents or that he himself was so incorrigible 
and illconditioned that neither good company nor good teaching could make any impression 
on him it is a great defect that thou labourest under and therefore i would have thee learn 
at any rate to sign thy name i can sign my name well enough said sancho for when i was steward 
of the brotherhood in my village i learned to make certain letters like the marks on bales 
of goods which they told me made out my name besides i can pretend my right hand is disabled 
and make some one else sign for me for theres a remedy for everything except death and as 
i shall be in command and hold the staff i can do as i like moreover he who has the alcalde 
for his father and ill be governor and thats higher than alcalde only come and see let them 
make light of me and abuse me theyll come for wool and go back shorn lovemaking and lawless 
desires are just as common in the fields as in the cities and in shepherds shanties as in 
royal palaces do away with the cause you do away with the sin if eyes dont see hearts dont 
break and better a clear escape than good mens prayers a truce to thy proverbs sancho exclaimed 
don quixote any one of those thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy meaning many 
a time have i recommended thee not to be so lavish with proverbs and to exercise some moderation 
in delivering them but it seems to me it is only preaching in the desert my mother beats 
me and i go on with my tricks i am bidding thee avoid proverbs and here in a second thou hast 
shot out a whole litany of them which have as much to do with what we are talking about as 
over the hills of ubeda the duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception 
so sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened and his hearers were not a little 
amused by it and then resuming the duchess said in consequence of what worthy sancho has 
told me a doubt starts up in my mind and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says if 
don quixote be mad crazy and cracked and sancho panza his squire knows it and notwithstanding 
serves and follows him and goes trusting to his empty promises there can be no doubt he 
must be still madder and sillier than his master and that being so it will be cast in your 
teeth senora duchess if you give the said sancho an island to govern for how will he who 
does not know how to take advantage of luck when it comes to him has no right to complain 
if it gives him the goby and now that it is knocking at our door it will not do to shut it out 
let us go with the favouring breeze that blows upon us it is this sort of talk and what sancho 
says lower down that made the translator of the history say he considered this chapter 
apocryphal dont you see you animal continued sancho that it will be well for me to drop 
into some profitable government that will lift us out of the mire and marry marisancha 
to whom i like and you yourself will find yourself called dona teresa panza and sitting 
in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies in spite and in defiance of all the 
born ladies of the town no stay as you are growing neither greater nor less like a tapestry 
figurelet us say no more about it and as her ladyship the princess proposes to set out tomorrow 
because it is too late today so be it and we will pass the night in pleasant conversation 
and tomorrow we will all accompany senor don quixote for we wish to witness the valiant 
and unparalleled achievements he is about to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise 
which he has undertaken it is i who shall wait upon and accompany you said don quixote and 
i am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me and the good opinion entertained 
of me which i shall strive to justify or it shall cost me my life or even more if it can possibly 
cost me more many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed between 
don quixote and don fernando but they were brought to an end by a traveller who at this moment 
entered the inn and who seemed from his attire to be a christian lately come from the country 
of the moors for he was dressed in a shortskirted coat of blue cloth with halfsleeves and 
without a collar his breeches were also of blue cloth and his cap of the same colour and 
he wore yellow buskins and had a moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast 
behind him mounted upon an ass there came a woman dressed in moorish fashion with her face 
veiled and a scarf on her head and wearing a little brocaded cap and a mantle that covered 
her from her shoulders to her feet the man was of a robust and wellproportioned frame in 
age a little over forty rather swarthy in complexion with long moustaches and a full beard 
and in short his appearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have been 
taken for a person of quality and good birth on entering he asked for a room and when they 
told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed and approaching her who by her dress 
seemed to be a moor he her down from saddle in his arms luscinda dorothea the landlady her 
daughter and maritornes attracted by the strange and to them entirely new costume gathered 
round her and dorothea who was always kindly courteous and quickwitted perceiving that 
both she and the man who had brought her were annoyed at not finding a room said to her do 
not be put out senora by the discomfort and want of luxuries here for it is the way of roadside 
inns to be without them still if you will be pleased to share our lodging with us pointing 
to luscinda perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey 
to this the veiled lady made no reply all she did was to rise from her seat crossing her hands 
upon her bosom bowing her head and bending her body as a sign that she returned thanks from 
her silence they concluded that she must be a moor and unable to speak a christian tongue 
at this moment the captive came up having been until now otherwise engaged and seeing 
that they all stood round his companion and that she made no reply to what they addressed 
to her he said ladies this damsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but 
that of her own country for which reason she does not and cannot answer what has been asked 
of her nothing has been asked of her returned luscinda she has only been offered our company 
for this evening and a share of the quarters we occupy where she shall be made as comfortable 
as the circumstances allow with the goodwill we are bound to show all strangers that stand 
in need of it especially if it be a woman to whom the service is rendered on her part and my 
own senora replied the captive i kiss your hands and i esteem highly as i ought the favour 
you have offered which on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance 
is it is plain to see a very great one tell me senor said dorothea is this lady a christian 
or a moor for her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we could wish she 
was not in dress and outwardly said he she is a moor but at heart she is a thoroughly good 
christian for she has the greatest desire to become one then she has not been baptised 
returned luscinda there has been no opportunity for that replied the captive since she 
left algiers her native country and home and up to the present she has not found herself 
in any such imminent danger of death as to make it necessary to baptise her before she has 
been instructed in all the ceremonies our holy mother church ordains but please god ere 
long she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher than her dress 
or mine indicates by these words he excited a desire in all who heard him to know who the 
moorish lady and the captive were but no one liked to ask just then seeing that it was a fitter 
moment for helping them to rest themselves than for questioning them about their lives 
dorothea took the moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself requested 
her to remove her veil she looked at the captive as if to ask him what they meant and what 
she was to do he said to her in arabic that they asked her to take off her veil and thereupon 
she removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely that to dorothea she seemed more 
beautiful than luscinda and to luscinda more beautiful than dorothea and all the bystanders 
felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the moorish ladys and there were 
even those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference and as it is the privilege 
and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure goodwill all forthwith became eager to 
show kindness and attention to the lovely moor don fernando asked the captive what her 
name was and he replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by way 
of a note i bade him tell it to me and he still laughing said in the margin as i told you this 
is written this dulcinea del toboso so often mentioned in this history had they say the 
best hand of any woman in all la mancha for salting pigs when i heard dulcinea del toboso 
named i was struck with surprise and amazement for it occurred to me at once that these 
pamphlets contained the history of don quixote with this idea i pressed him to read the 
beginning and doing so turning the arabic offhand into castilian he told me it meant history 
of don quixote of la mancha was that a man of that sort and shape he had never yet seen he marvelled 
at the length of his hair his lofty stature the lankness and sallowness of his countenance 
his armour his bearing and his gravitya figure and picture such as had not been seen in 
those regions for many a long day don quixote saw very plainly the attention with which 
the traveller was regarding him and read his curiosity in his astonishment and courteous 
as he was and ready to please everybody before the other could ask him any question he anticipated 
him by saying the appearance i present to your worship being so strange and so out of the 
common i should not be surprised if it filled you with wonder but you will cease to wonder 
when i tell you as i do that i am one of those knights who as people say go seeking adventures 
i have left my home i have mortgaged my estate i have given up my comforts and committed 
myself to the arms of fortune to bear me whithersoever she may please my desire was to bring 
to life again knighterrantry now dead and for some time past stumbling here falling there 
now coming down headlong now raising myself up again i have carried out a great portion 
of my design succouring widows protecting maidens and giving aid to wives orphans and 
minors the proper and natural duty of knightserrant and therefore because of my many 
valiant and christian achievements i have been already found worthy to make my way in 
print to wellnigh all or most of the nations of the earth thirty thousand volumes of my 
history have been printed and it is on the highroad to be printed thirty thousand thousands 
of times if heaven does not put a stop to it in short to sum up all in a few words or in a single 
one i may tell you i am don quixote of la mancha otherwise called the knight of the rueful 
countenance by the life of my father said sancho when he heard the letter it is the loftiest 
thing i ever heard body of me how your worship says everything as you like in it and how well 
you fit in the knight of the rueful countenance was still very anxious to find out who the 
owner of the valise could be conjecturing from the sonnet and letter from the money in 
gold and from the fineness of the shirts that he must be some lover of distinction whom 
the scorn and cruelty of his lady had driven to some desperate course but as in that uninhabited 
and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire he saw nothing else for 
it but to push on taking whatever road rocinante chosewhich was where he could make his 
wayfirmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure 
as he went along then occupied with these thoughts he perceived on the summit of a height 
that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock 
to tussock with marvellous agility as well as he could make out he was unclad with a thick 
black beard long tangled hair and bare legs and feet his thighs were covered by breeches 
apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places he 
was bareheaded and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed as has been described 
the knight of the rueful countenance the bachelor then took his departure i forgot to 
mention that before he did so he said to don quixote remember that you stand excommunicated 
for having laid violent hands on a holy thing juxta illud si quis suadente diabolo i do 
not understand that latin answered don quixote but i know well i did not lay hands only 
this pike besides i did not think i was committing an assault upon priests or things of 
the church which like a catholic and faithful christian as i am i respect and revere but 
upon phantoms and spectres of the other world but even so i remember how it fared with cid 
ruy diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of that king before his holiness the 
pope who excommunicated him for the same and yet the good roderick of vivar bore himself 
that day like a very noble and valiant knight on hearing this the bachelor took his departure 
as has been said without making any reply and don quixote asked sancho what had induced 
him to call him the knight of the rueful countenance for perhaps he did not utter them without 
cause and from his good sense and christian conscience it is not likely that he would bear 
false witness against anyone we may therefore believe without any hesitation that since 
as you say sir knight everything in this castle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment 
sancho i say may possibly have seen through this diabolical medium what he says he saw 
so much to the detriment of my modesty i swear by god omnipotent exclaimed don quixote 
at this your highness has hit the point and that some vile illusion must have come before 
this sinner of a sancho that made him see what it would have been impossible to see by any 
other means than enchantments for i know well enough from the poor fellows goodness and 
harmlessness that he is incapable of bearing false witness against anybody true no doubt 
said don fernando for which reason senor don quixote you ought to forgive him and restore 
him to the bosom of your favour sicut erat in principio before illusions of this sort had 
taken away his senses don quixote said he was ready to pardon him and the curate went for 
sancho who came in very humbly and falling on his knees begged for the hand of his master 
who having presented it to him and allowed him to kiss it gave him his blessing and said 
now sancho my son thou wilt be convinced of the truth of what i say look at me printed in histories 
famed in arms courteous in behaviour honoured by princes courted by maidens and after 
all when i looked forward to palms triumphs and crowns won and earned by my valiant deeds 
i have this morning seen myself trampled on kicked and crushed by the feet of unclean and 
filthy animals this thought blunts my teeth paralyses my jaws cramps my hands and robs 
me of all appetite for food so much so that i have a mind to let myself die of hunger the cruelest 
death of all deaths so then said sancho munching hard all the time your worship does not 
agree with the proverb that says let martha die but let her die with a full belly i at any 
rate have no mind to kill myself so far from that i mean to do as the cobbler does who stretches 
the leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants ill stretch out my life 
by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it and let me tell you senor theres 
no greater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does take my advice and 
after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green grassmattress and you will see that 
when you awake youll feel something better don quixote did as he recommended for it struck 
him that sanchos reasoning was more like a philosophers than a blockheads and said he 
sancho if thou wilt do for me what i am going to tell now sancho was seated on the captains 
stage close to the aftermost rower on the righthand side he previously instructed in 
what he was to do laid hold of sancho hoisting him up in his arms and the whole crew who were 
standing ready beginning on the right proceeded to pass him on whirling him along from 
hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor 
sanchos eyes and he made quite sure that the devils themselves were flying away with him 
nor did they leave off with him until they had sent him back along the left side and deposited 
him on the poop and the poor fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat and 
unable to comprehend what it was that had happened to him don quixote when he saw sanchos 
flight without wings asked the general if this was a usual ceremony with those who came 
on board the galleys for the first time for if so as he had no intention of adopting them 
as a profession he had no mind to perform such feats of agility and if anyone offered to 
lay hold of him to whirl him about he vowed to god he would kick his soul out and as he said 
this he stood up and clapped his hand upon his sword at this instant they struck the awning 
and lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle sancho thought heaven was coming off its 
hinges and going to fall on his head and full of terror he ducked it and buried it between 
his knees nor were don quixotes knees altogether under control for he too shook a little 
squeezed his shoulders together and lost colour the crew then hoisted the yard with the 
same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it all the while keeping silence as though 
they had neither voice nor breath the boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor and leaping 
upon the middle of the gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash 
or whip and to haul out gradually to sea when sancho saw so many red feet for such he took 
the oars to be moving all together he said to himself its these that are the real chanted 
things and not the ones my master talks of what can those wretches have done to be so whipped 
and how does that one man who goes along there whistling dare to whip so many i declare this 
is hell or at least purgatory don quixote observing how attentively sancho regarded 
what was going on said to him ah sancho my friend how quickly and cheaply might you finish 
off the disenchantment of dulcinea if you would strip to the waist and take your place 
among those gentlemen amid the pain and sufferings of so many you would not feel your own 
much and moreover perhaps the sage merlin would allow each of these lashes being laid 
on with a good hand to count for ten of those which you must give yourself at last the general 
was about to ask what these lashes were and what was dulcineas disenchantment when a sailor 
exclaimed monjui signals that there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west on hearing 
this the general sprang upon the gangway crying now then my sons dont let her give us the 
slip it must be some algerine corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us the 
three others immediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders the 
general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other kept in shore so that in this 
way the vessel could not escape them the crews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously 
that they seemed to fly the two that had put out to sea after a couple of miles sighted a vessel 
which so far as they could make out they judged to be one of fourteen or fifteen banks and 
so she proved as soon as the vessel discovered the galleys she went about with the object 
and in the hope of making her escape by her speed but the attempt failed for the chief galley 
was one of the fastest vessels afloat and overhauled her so rapidly that they on board 
the brigantine saw clearly there was no possibility of escaping and the rais therefore 
would have had them drop their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain 
in command of our galleys to anger but chance directing things otherwise so ordered it 
that just as the chief galley came close enough for those on board the vessel to hear the 
shouts from her calling on them to surrender two toraquis that is to say two turks both 
drunken that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine discharged their muskets 
killing two of the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel seeing this the general 
swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vessel alive but as he bore down 
furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars the galley shot a good 
way ahead those on board the vessel saw their case was desperate and while the galley was 
coming about they made sail and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off but their 
activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm for the galley coming 
up with them in a little more than half a league they perceived some dozen men dressed like 
labourers stretched upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner 
they had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some objects under them 
standing upright or lying flat and arranged at intervals don quixote approached the 
diners and saluting them courteously first he asked them what it was those cloths covered 
senor answered one of the party under these cloths are some images carved in relief intended 
for a retablo we are putting up in our village we carry them covered up that they may not 
be soiled and on our shoulders that they may not be broken with your good leave said don 
quixote i hereby for this once waive my privilege of gentle blood and come down and put 
myself on a level with the lowly birth of the wrongdoer making myself equal with him and 
enabling him to enter into combat with me and so i challenge and defy him though absent 
on the plea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel who was a maiden 
and now by his misdeed is none and say that he shall fulfill the promise he gave her to become 
her lawful husband or else stake his life upon the question and then plucking off a glove 
he threw it down in the middle of the hall and the duke picked it up saying as he had said before 
that he accepted the challenge in the name of his vassal and fixed six days thence as the 
time the courtyard of the castle as the place and for arms the customary ones of knights 
lance and shield and full armour with all the other accessories without trickery guile 
or charms of any sort and examined and passed by the judges of the field but first of all 
he said it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy damsel should place their 
claim for justice in the hands of don quixote for otherwise nothing can be done nor can 
the said challenge be brought to a lawful issue i do so place it replied the duenna and i 
too added her daughter all in tears and covered with shame and confusion this declaration 
having been made and the duke having settled in his own mind what he would do in the matter 
the ladies in black withdrew and the duchess gave orders that for the future they were 
not to be treated as servants of hers but as lady adventurers who came to her house to demand 
justice so they gave them a room to themselves and waited on them as they would on strangers 
to the consternation of the other womenservants who did not know where the folly and imprudence 
of dona rodriguez and her unlucky daughter would stop and now to complete the enjoyment 
of the feast and bring the dinner to a satisfactory end lo and behold the page who had carried 
the letters and presents to teresa panza the wife of the governor sancho entered the hall 
and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him being anxious to know the result 
of his journey but when they asked him the page said in reply that he could not give it before 
so many people or in a few words and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait 
for a private opportunity and in the meantime amuse themselves with these letters and 
taking out the letters he placed them in the duchesss hand one bore by way of address letter 
for my lady the duchess soandso of i dont know where and the other to my husband sancho panza 
governor of the island of barataria into his own hands or those of his secretary sancho 
when he heard this said which of you is my secretary i am senor said one of those present 
for i can read and write and am a biscayan with that addition said sancho you might be secretary 
to the emperor himself open this paper and see what it says the newborn secretary obeyed 
and having read the contents said the matter was one to be discussed in private sancho 
ordered the chamber to be cleared the majordomo and the carver only remaining so the doctor 
and the others withdrew and then the secretary read the letter which was as follows it 
has come to my knowledge senor don sancho panza that certain enemies of mine and of the 
island are about to make a furious attack upon it some night i know not when it behoves you 
to be on the alert and keep watch that they surprise you not i also know by trustworthy spies 
that four persons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life because 
they stand in dread of your great capacity keep your eyes open and take heed who approaches 
you to address you and eat nothing that is presented to you i will take care to send you aid 
if you find yourself in difficulty but in all things you will act as may be expected of your 
judgment from this place the sixteenth of august at four in the morning your friend the 
duke sancho was astonished and those who stood by made believe to be so too and turning 
to the majordomo he said to him what we have got to do first and it must be done at once is to 
put doctor recio in the lockup for if anyone wants to kill me it is he and by a slow death and 
the worst of all which is hunger likewise said the carver it is my opinion your worship 
should not eat anything that is on this table for the whole was a present from some nuns 
and as they say behind the cross theres the devil i dont deny it said sancho so for the present 
give me a piece of bread and four pounds or so of grapes no poison can come in them for the 
fact is i cant go on without eating and if we are to be prepared for these battles that are 
threatening us we must be well provisioned for it is the tripes that carry the heart and 
not the heart the tripes and you secretary answer my lord the duke and tell him that all 
his commands shall be obeyed to the letter as he directs and say from me to my lady the duchess 
that i kiss her hands and that i beg of her not to forget to send my letter and bundle to my 
wife teresa panza by a messenger and i will take it as a great favour and will not fail to 
serve her in all that may lie within my power and as you are about it you may enclose a kiss 
of the hand to my master don quixote that he may see i am grateful bread and as a good secretary 
and a good biscayan you may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best and now 
take away this cloth and give me something to eat and let me go at once for i mean to return 
this evening come and do penance with me said the curate at this for senora teresa has more 
will than means to serve so worthy a guest the page refused but had to consent at last for 
his own sake and the curate took him home with him very gladly in order to have an opportunity 
of questioning him at leisure about don quixote and his doings the bachelor offered to 
write the letters in reply for teresa but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her 
affairs for she thought him somewhat given to joking and so she gave a cake and a couple 
of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman and he wrote for her two letters one for her husband 
and the other for the duchess dictated out of her own head which are not the worst inserted 
in this great history as will be seen farther on chapter li of the progress of sanchos government 
and other such entertaining matters day came after the night of the governors round a 
night which the headcarver passed without sleeping so were his thoughts of the face and 
air and beauty of the disguised damsel while the majordomo spent what was left of it in 
writing an account to his lord and lady of all sancho said and did being as much amazed at 
his sayings as at his doings for there was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all 
his words and deeds the senor governor got up and by doctor pedro recios directions they 
made him break his fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold water which sancho would 
have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes but seeing there was no 
help for it he submitted with no little sorrow of heart and discomfort of stomach pedro 
recio having persuaded him that light and delicate diet enlivened the wits and that was 
what was most essential for persons placed in command and in responsible situations 
where they have to employ not only the bodily powers but those of the mind also by means 
of this sophistry sancho was made to endure hunger and hunger so keen that in his heart 
he cursed the government and even him who had given it to him however with his hunger and 
his conserve he undertook to deliver judgments that day and the first thing that came 
before him was a question that was submitted to him by a stranger in the presence of the 
majordomo and the other attendants and it was in these words senor a large river separated 
two districts of one and the same lordshipwill your worship please to pay attention for 
the case is an important and a rather knotty one well then on this river there was a bridge 
and at one end of it a gallows and a sort of tribunal where four judges commonly sat to administer 
the law which the lord of river bridge and the lordship had enacted and which was to this 
effect if anyone crosses by this bridge from one side to the other made it seem as if there 
was a legion of devils at large in it they extinguished the candles that were burning in 
the room and rushed about seeking some way of escape the cord with the large bells never 
ceased rising and falling and most of the people of the castle not knowing what was really 
the matter were at their wits end with astonishment don quixote sprang to his feet and 
drawing his sword began making passes at the grating shouting out avaunt malignant enchanters 
avaunt ye witchcraftworking rabble i am don quixote of la mancha he who hath filled the 
whole world with his achievements roque guinart at once perceived that don quixotes 
weakness was more akin to madness than to swagger and though he had sometimes heard him 
spoken of he never regarded the things attributed to him as true nor could he persuade 
himself that such a humour could become dominant in the heart of man he was extremely glad 
therefore to meet him and test at close quarters what he had heard of him at a distance so 
he said to him despair not valiant knight nor regard as an untoward fate the position in 
which thou findest thyself it may be that by these slips thy crooked fortune will make 
itself straight for heaven by strange circuitous ways mysterious and incomprehensible 
to man raises up the fallen and makes rich the poor don quixote was about to thank him when 
they heard behind them a noise as of a troop of horses there was however but one riding on 
which at a furious pace came a youth apparently about twenty years of age clad in green 
damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock with a hat looped up in the walloon 
fashion tightfitting polished boots gilt spurs dagger and sword and in his hand a musketoon 
and a pair of pistols at his waist roque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely 
figure which drawing near thus addressed him i came in quest of thee valiant roque to find 
in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my misfortune and not to keep thee in suspense 
for i see thou dost not recognise me i will tell thee who i am i am claudia jeronima the daughter 
of simon forte thy good friend and special enemy of clauquel torrellas who is thine also 
as being of the faction opposed to thee thou knowest that this torrellas has a son who is 
called or at least was not two hours since don vicente torrellas well to cut short the tale 
of my misfortune i will tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me he saw 
me he paid court to me i listened to him and unknown to my father i loved him for there is no 
woman however secluded she may live or close she may be kept who will not have opportunities 
and to spare for following her headlong impulses in a word he pledged himself to be mine 
and i promised to be his without carrying matters any further yesterday i learned that 
forgetful of his pledge to me he was about to marry another and that he was to go this morning 
to plight his troth intelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me my father not 
being at home i was able to adopt this costume you see and urging my horse to speed i overtook 
don vicente about a league from this and without waiting to utter reproaches or hear excuses 
i fired this musket at him and these two pistols besides and to the best of my belief that 
tomasillo the scapegrace the son of balbastro the smith was wounded inisnt all this true 
master mine as you live say so that these gentlefolk may not take me for some lying chatterer 
so far said the ecclesiastic i take you to be more a chatterer than a liar but i dont know 
what i shall take you for byandby thou citest so many witnesses and proofs sancho said 
don quixote that i did not feel when they were blanketing thee if thou dost thou must not 
say so or think so for i felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in body but let us put 
that aside for the present for we shall have opportunities enough for considering and 
settling the point tell me sancho my friend what do they say about me in the village here 
what do the common people think of me what do the hidalgos what do the caballeros what do 
they say of my valour of my achievements of my courtesy how do they treat the task i have 
undertaken in reviving and restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry 
in short sancho i would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this subject 
and thou art to tell me without adding anything to the good or taking away anything from 
the bad for it is the duty of loyal vassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and 
in its proper shape not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it 
and i would have thee know sancho that all or most of the expedients which are proposed 
to his majesty are either impossible or absurd or injurious to the king and to the kingdom 
mine however replied don quixote is neither impossible nor absurd but the easiest the 
most reasonable the readiest and most expeditious that could suggest itself to any projectors 
mind you take a long time to tell it senor don quixote said the duchess is nearly suppertime 
and the duke is is probably waiting come let us go to supper and retire to rest early for 
the journey you made yesterday from kandy was not such a short one but that it must have 
caused you some fatigue i feel none senora said don quixote for i would go so far as to swear 
to your excellence that in all my life i never mounted a quieter beast or a pleasanter paced 
one than clavileno and i dont know what could have induced malambruno to discard a steed 
so swift and so gentle and burn it so recklessly as he did probably said the duchess repenting 
of the evil he had done to the trifaldi and company and others and the crimes he must have 
committed as a wizard and enchanter he resolved to make away with all the instruments 
of his craft and so burned clavileno as the chief one and that which mainly kept him restless 
wandering from land to land and by its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of 
the great don quixote of la mancha sighed for her tobosos queen from side to side he traversed 
the grim sierra the champaign of aranjuez and montiels famous plain on rocinante oft 
a weary ride malignant planets cruel destiny pursued them both the fair manchegan dame 
and the unconquered star of chivalry nor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim of death 
he paid loves bitter penalty and left the marble to preserve his name caprichoso a most 
acute academician of argamasilla in praise of rocinante steed of don quixote of la mancha 
those who are coming this way are six troops of enchanters who are bringing on a triumphal 
car the peerless dulcinea del toboso she comes under enchantment together with the gallant 
frenchman montesinos to give instructions to don quixote as to how she the said lady may 
be disenchanted if you were the devil as you say and as your appearance indicates said 
the duke you would have known the said knight don quixote of la mancha was carried away 
enchanted together with other remarkable incidents when don quixote saw himself caged 
and hoisted on the cart in this way he said many grave histories of knightserrant have 
i read but never yet have i read seen or heard of their carrying off enchanted knightserrant 
in this fashion or at the slow pace that these lazy sluggish animals promise for they always 
take them away through the air with marvellous swiftness enveloped in a dark thick cloud 
or on a chariot of fire or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind but to carry 
me off like this on an oxcart by god it puzzles me but perhaps the chivalry and enchantments 
of our day take a different course from that of those in days gone by and it may be too that 
as i am a new knight in the world and the first to revive the already forgotten calling of 
knightadventurers they may have newly invented other kinds of enchantments and other 
modes of carrying off the enchanted what thinkest thou of the matter sancho my son i dont 
know what to think of it for here they tell me that the governors that come to this island 
before entering it have plenty of money either given to them or lent to them by the people 
of the town and that this is the usual custom not only here but with all who enter upon governments 
last night going the rounds i came upon a fair damsel in mans clothes and a brother of hers 
dressed as a woman my headcarver has fallen in love with the girl and has in his own mind 
chosen her for a wife so he says and i have chosen youth for a soninlaw today we are going 
to explain our intentions to the father of the pair who is one diego de la llana a gentleman 
and an old christian as much as you please i have visited the marketplaces as your worship 
advises me and yesterday i found a stallkeeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to 
have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new i confiscated the whole 
for the children of the charityschool who will know how to distinguish them well enough 
and i sentenced her not to come into the marketplace for a fortnight they told me i did bravely 
i can tell your worship it is commonly said in this town that there are no people worse than 
the marketwomen for they are all barefaced unconscionable and impudent and i can well 
believe it from what i have seen of them in other towns i am very glad my lady the duchess 
has written to my wife teresa panza giving her an account of all that has happened me since 
i left her i have it here in my pocket and putting his hand into his right pocket he pulled 
out a masquerade nose of varnished pasteboard of the make already described and sancho 
examining him more and more closely exclaimed aloud in a voice of amazement holy mary 
be good to me isnt it tom cecial my neighbour and gossip why to be sure i am returned the now 
unnosed squire tom cecial i am gossip and friend sancho panza and ill tell you presently 
the means and tricks and falsehoods by which i have been brought here but in the meantime 
beg and entreat of your master not to touch maltreat wound or slay the knight of the mirrors 
whom he has at his feet because beyond all dispute it is the rash and illadvised bachelor 
samson carrasco our fellow townsman at this moment he of the mirrors came to himself and 
don quixote perceiving it held the naked point of his sword over his face and said to him 
you are a dead man knight unless you confess that the peerless dulcinea del toboso excels 
your casildea de vandalia in beauty and in addition to this you must promise if you should 
survive this encounter and fall to go to the city of el toboso and there present yourselves 
before the lady dulcinea del toboso the ass and rocinante sancho and don quixote were 
all that were left upon the spot the ass with drooping head serious shaking his ears from 
time to time as if he were still alive as he said this the wretched durandarte cried out 
in a loud voice is it possible there is anyone in the world who will dare to say and swear 
that this master of mine is a tologian or if not faith hes as like one as one egg is like another 
don quixote stopped to take breath and observing that silence was still preserved had 
a mind to continue his discourse and would have done so had he not been prevented by what 
must be told farther on chapter xxi in which camachos wedding is continued with other 
delightful incidents while don quixote and sancho were shut up together they had a discussion 
which the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness sancho said 
to his master senor would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you for since you 
laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to rot in my stomach 
and i have now just one on the tip of my tongue for all that sancho said don quixote take heed 
of what thou sayest for the pitcher goes so often to the welli need say no more to thee well 
well said sancho god is in heaven and sees all tricks and will judge who does most harm i 
in not speaking right or your worship in not doing it that is enough said dorothea run sancho 
and kiss your lords hand and beg his pardon and henceforward be more circumspect with 
your praise and abuse and say nothing in disparagement of that lady toboso of whom i know 
nothing save that i am her servant and put your trust in god for you will not fail to obtain 
some dignity so as to live like a prince sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his 
masters hand which don quixote with dignity presented to him giving him his blessing 
as soon as he had kissed it he then bade him go on ahead a little as he had questions to ask 
him and matters of great importance to discuss with him at the same time he bade camilla 
not to leave lothario alone until he came back in short he contrived to put so good a face 
on the reason or the folly of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence 
anselmo took his departure and camilla and lothario were left alone at the table for the 
rest of the household had gone to dinner lothario saw himself in the lists according to 
his friends wish and facing an enemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron 
of armed knights judge whether he had good reason to fear but what he did was to lean his 
elbow on the arm of the chair and his cheek upon his hand and asking camillas pardon for 
his ill manners he said he wished to take a little sleep until anselmo returned camilla 
in reply said he could repose more at his ease in the receptionroom than in his chair and 
begged of him to go in and sleep there but lothario declined and there he remained asleep 
until the return of anselmo who finding camilla in her own room and lothario asleep imagined 
that he had stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for conversation and 
even for sleep and was all impatience until lothario should wake up that he might go out 
with him and question him as to his success everything fell out as he wished lothario awoke 
and the two at once left the house and anselmo asked what he was anxious to know and lothario 
in answer told him that he had not thought it advisable to declare himself entirely the 
first time and therefore had only extolled the charms of camilla telling her that all 
the city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit for this seemed to him an excellent 
way of beginning to gain her goodwill and render her disposed to listen to him with pleasure 
the next time thus availing himself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would 
deceive one who is on the watch for he being the angel of darkness transforms himself into 
an angel of light and under cover of a fair seeming discloses himself at length and effects 
his purpose if at the beginning his wiles are not discovered all this gave great satisfaction 
to anselmo and he said he would afford the same opportunity every day but without leaving 
the house for he would find things to do at home so that camilla should not detect the plot 
thus then several days went by and lothario without uttering a word to camilla reported 
to anselmo that he had talked with her and that he had never been able to do so for the moorish 
women do not allow themselves to be seen by any moor or turk unless their husband or father 
bid them with christian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and communication 
even more than might be considered proper but for my part i should have been sorry if he 
had spoken to her for perhaps it might have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by 
renegades but god who ordered it otherwise afforded no opportunity for our renegades 
wellmeant purpose and he seeing how safely he could go to shershel and return and anchor 
when and how and where he liked and that the tagarin his partner had no will but his and that 
now i was ransomed all we wanted was to find some christians to row told me to look out for 
any i should be willing to take with me over and above those who had been ransomed and to 
engage them for the next friday which he fixed upon for our departure on this i spoke to 
twelve spaniards all stout rowers and such as could most easily leave the city but it was 
no easy matter to find so many just then because there were twenty ships out on a cruise 
and they had taken all the rowers with them and these would not have been found were it not 
that their master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order to finish 
a galliot that he had upon the stocks to these men i said nothing more than that the next 
friday in the evening they were to come out stealthily one by one and hang about hadji moratos 
garden waiting for me there until i came these directions i gave each one separately with 
orders that if they saw any other christians there they were not to say anything to them 
except that i had directed them to wait at that spot this preliminary having been settled 
another still more necessary step had to be taken which was to let zoraida know how matters 
stood that she might be prepared and forewarned so as not to be taken by surprise if we were 
suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the christians vessel could have returned 
i determined therefore to go to the garden and try if i could speak to her and the day before 
my departure i went there under the pretence of gathering herbs the first person i met 
was her father who addressed me in the language that all over barbary and even in constantinople 
is the medium between captives and moors and is neither morisco nor castilian nor of any 
other nation but a mixture of all languages by means of which we can all understand one 
another in this sort of language i say he asked me what i wanted in his garden and to whom 
i belonged i replied that i was a slave of the arnaut mami for i knew as a certainty that he 
was a very great friend of his and that i wanted some herbs to make a salad he asked me then 
whether i were on ransom or not and what my master demanded for me while these questions 
and answers were proceeding the fair zoraida who had already perceived me some time before 
came out of the house in the garden and as moorish women are by no means particular about 
letting themselves be seen by christians or as i have said before at all coy she had no hesitation 
in coming to where her father stood with me moreover her father seeing her approaching 
slowly called to her to come it would be beyond my power now to describe to you the great 
beauty the highbred air the brilliant attire of my beloved zoraida as she presented herself 
before my eyes i will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from her fair neck 
her ears and her hair than she had hairs on her head on her ankles which as is customary were 
bare she had carcajes for so bracelets or anklets are called in morisco of the purest gold 
set with so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued them at ten thousand 
doubloons and those she had on her wrists were worth as much more the pearls were in profusion 
and very fine for the highest display and adornment of the moorish women is decking themselves 
with rich pearls and seedpearls and of these there are therefore more among the moors 
than among any other people zoraidas father had to the reputation of possessing a great 
number and the purest in all algiers and of possessing also more than two hundred thousand 
spanish crowns and she who is now mistress of me only was mistress of all this whether thus 
adorned she would have been beautiful or not and what she must have been in her prosperity 
may be imagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships for as everyone 
knows the beauty of some women has its times and its seasons and is increased or diminished 
by chance causes and naturally the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it though 
indeed more frequently they totally destroy it in a word she presented herself before 
me that day attired with the utmost splendour and supremely beautiful at any rate she 
seemed to me the most beautiful object i had ever seen and when besides i thought of all 
i owed to her i felt as though i had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me 
relief and happiness as she approached her father told her in his own language that i was 
a captive belonging to his friend the arnaut mami and that i had come for salad she took 
up the conversation and in that mixture of tongues i have spoken of she asked me if i was 
a gentleman and why i was not ransomed i answered that i was already ransomed and that by 
the price it might be seen what value my master set on me as i had given one thousand five 
hundred zoltanis for me to which she replied hadst thou been my fathers i can tell thee 
i would not have let him part with thee for twice as much for you christians always tell 
lies about yourselves and make yourselves out poor to cheat the moors that may be lady 
said i but indeed i dealt truthfully with my master as i do and mean to do with everybody 
in the world and when dost thou go said zoraida tomorrow i think said i for there is a vessel 
here from france which sails tomorrow and i think i shall go in her would it not be better 
said zoraida to wait for the arrival of ships from spain and go with them and not with the 
french who are not your friends no said i though if there were intelligence that a vessel 
were now coming from spain it is true i might perhaps wait for it however it is more likely 
i shall depart tomorrow for the longing i feel to return to my country and to those i love 
is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity however more convenient 
if it be delayed no doubt thou art married in thine own country said zoraida and for that 
reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife i am not married i replied but i have given 
my promise to marry on my arrival there and is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given 
it said zoraida so beautiful said i that to describe her worthily and tell thee the truth 
she is very like thee at this her father laughed very heartily and said by allah christian 
she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter who is the most beautiful woman in 
all this kingdom only look at her well and thou wilt see i am telling the truth wait a bit 
and listen for this art like swimming once learnt is never forgotten and then taking hold 
of his nose he began to bray so vigorously that all the valleys around rang again one of 
those however that stood near him fancying he was mocking them lifted up a long staff he 
had in his hand and smote him such a blow with it that sancho dropped helpless to the ground 
don quixote seeing him so roughly handled attacked the man who had struck him lance in 
hand but so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him far from it 
finding a shower of stones rained upon him and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled 
at him he wheeled rocinante round and as fast as his best gallop could take him fled from 
the midst of them commending himself to god with all his heart to deliver him out of this 
peril in dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming out at his breast 
and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it had gone from him the members of the 
band however were satisfied with seeing him take to flight and did not fire on him they 
put up sancho scarcely restored to his senses on his ass and let him go after his master 
not that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast but dapple followed the footsteps 
of rocinante from whom he could not remain a moment separated don quixote having got some 
way off looked back and seeing sancho coming waited for him as he perceived that no one 
followed him the men of the troop stood their ground till night and as the enemy did not 
come out to battle they returned to their town exulting and had they been aware of the ancient 
custom of the greeks they would have erected a trophy on the spot chapter xxviii of matters 
that benengeli says he who reads them will know if he reads them with attention when the 
brave man flees treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to reserve themselves for 
better occasions this proved to be the case with don quixote who giving way before the 
fury of the townsfolk and the hostile intentions of the angry troop took to flight and 
without a thought of sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him retreated to such 
a distance as he thought made him safe sancho lying across his ass followed him as has been 
said and at length came up having by this time recovered his senses and on joining him let 
himself drop off dapple at rocinantes feet sore bruised and belaboured don quixote dismounted 
to examine his wounds but finding him whole from head to foot he said to him angrily enough 
in an evil hour didst thou take to braying sancho where hast thou learned that it is well 
done to mention the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged to the music of brays 
what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels give thanks to god sancho that they 
signed the cross on thee just now with a stick and did not mark thee per signum crucis with 
a cutlass im not equal to answering said sancho for i feel as if i was speaking through my 
shoulders let us mount and get away from this ill keep from braying but not from saying 
that knightserrant fly and leave their good squires to be pounded like privet or made 
meal of at the hands of their enemies he does not fly who retires returned don quixote for 
i would have thee know sancho that if the naked truth undisguised by flattery came to the 
ears of princes times would be different and other ages would be reckoned iron ages more 
than ours which i hold to be the golden of these latter days profit by this advice sancho 
and report to me clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest touching what i 
have demanded of thee that i will do with all my heart master replied sancho provided your 
worship will not be vexed at what i say as you wish me to say it out in all its nakedness without 
putting any more clothes on it than it came to my knowledge in i will not be vexed at all returned 
don quixote thou mayest speak freely sancho and without any beating about the bush well 
then said he first of all i have to tell you that the common people consider your worship 
a mighty great madman and me no less a fool the hidalgos say that not keeping within the 
bounds of your quality of gentleman you have assumed the don and made a knight of yourself 
at a jump with four vinestocks and a couple of acres of land and never a shirt to your back 
the caballeros say they do not want to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them particularly 
squire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with green 
silk that said don quixote does not apply to me for i always go well dressed and never patched 
ragged i may be but ragged more from the wear and tear of arms than of time as to your worships 
valour courtesy accomplishments and task there is a variety of opinions some say mad 
but droll others valiant but unlucky others courteous but meddling and then they go into 
such a number of things that they dont leave a whole bone either in your worship or in myself 
recollect sancho said don quixote that wherever virtue exists in an eminent degree it 
is persecuted few or none of the famous men that have lived escaped being calumniated 
by malice julius caesar the boldest wisest and bravest of captains was charged with being 
ambitious and not particularly cleanly in his dress or pure in his morals of alexander 
whose deeds won him the name of great they say that he was somewhat of a drunkard of hercules 
him of the many labours it is said that he was lewd and luxurious of don galaor the brother 
of amadis of gaul because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion and was no finikin 
knight nor lachrymose like his brother while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind 
him in short he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise 
and his days from dawn to dark poring over them and what with little sleep and much reading 
his brains got so dry that he lost his wits his fancy grew full of what he used to read about 
in his books enchantments quarrels battles challenges wounds wooings loves agonies 
and all sorts of impossible nonsense and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric 
of invention and fancy he read of was true that to him no history in the world had more reality 
in it he used to say the cid ruy diaz was a very good knight but that he was not to be compared 
with thine phoebus of spain marvel of courtesy nor with thy famous arm this hand of mine 
that smote from east to west as lightnings fly i scorned all empire and that monarchy the 
rosy east held out did i resign for one glance of claridianas eye the bright aurora for

of yours have quite upset but aught of base or mean hath never yet been charged by any in 
reproach to you your deeds are open proof in all mens view for you went forth injustice 
to abate and for your pains sore drubbings did you get from many a rascally and ruffian 
crew if the fair dulcinea your hearts queen be unrelenting in her cruelty if still your 
woe be powerless to move her in such hard case your comfort let it be that sancho was a sorry

no great sense b youre metaphysicalr from want of food b rail at the squire thenr why whats 
the good i might indeed complain of him i grant ye but squire or master wheres the difference 
theyre both as sorry hacks as rocinante the authors preface idle reader thou mayest believe 
me without any oath that i would this book as it is the child of my brain were the fairest 
gayest and cleverest that could be imagined but i could not counteract natures law that 
everything shall beget its like and what then could this sterile illtilled wit of mine 
beget but the story of a dry shrivelled whimsical offspring full of thoughts of all sorts 
and such as never came into any other imaginationjust what might be begotten in a prison 
where every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling tranquillity 
a cheerful retreat pleasant fields bright skies murmuring brooks peace of mind these 
are the things that go far to make even the most barren muses fertile and bring into the 
world births that fill it with wonder and delight sometimes when a father has an ugly loutish 
son the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does not see his defects or rather 
takes them for gifts and charms of mind and body and talks of them to his friends as wit and 
grace i howeverfor though i pass for the father i am but the stepfather to don quixotehave 
no desire to go with the current of custom or to implore thee dearest reader almost with 
tears in my eyes as others do to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive in this 
child of mine thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend thy soul is thine own and thy will 
as free as any mans whateer he be thou art in thine own house and master of it as much as the 
king of his taxes and thou knowest the common saying under my cloak i kill the king all which 
exempts and frees thee from every consideration and obligation and thou canst say what 
thou wilt of the story without fear of being abused for any ill or rewarded for any good 
thou mayest say of it my wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned without 
any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary sonnets epigrams and 
eulogies such as are commonly put at the beginning of books for i can tell thee though composing 
it cost me some labour i found none greater than the making of this preface thou art now 
reading many times did i take up my pen to write it and many did i lay it down again not knowing 
what to write one of these times as i was pondering with the paper before me a pen in my ear 
my elbow on the desk and my cheek in my hand thinking of what i should say there came in unexpectedly 
a certain lively clever friend of mine who seeing me so deep in thought asked the reason 
to which i making no mystery of it answered that i was thinking of the preface i had to make 
for the story of don quixote which so troubled me that i had a mind not to make any at all nor 
even publish the achievements of so noble a knight for how could you expect me not to feel 
uneasy about what that ancient lawgiver they call the public will say when it sees me after 
slumbering so many years in the silence of oblivion coming out now with all my years upon 
my back and with a book as dry as a rush devoid of invention meagre in style poor in thoughts 
wholly wanting in learning and wisdom without quotations in the margin or annotations 
at the end after the fashion of other books i see which though all fables and profanity 
are so full of maxims from aristotle and plato and the whole herd of philosophers that 
they fill the readers with amazement and convince them that the authors are men of learning 
erudition and eloquence and then when they quote the holy scripturesanyone would say 
they are st thomases or other doctors of the church observing as they do a decorum so ingenious 
that in one sentence they describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout 
little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear and read of all this there will be 
nothing in my book for i have nothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end and still 
less do i know what authors i follow in it to place them at the beginning as all do under the 
letters a b c beginning with aristotle and ending with xenophon or zoilus or zeuxis though 
one was a slanderer and the other a painter also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning 
at least sonnets whose authors are dukes marquises counts bishops ladies or famous poets 
though if i were to ask two or three obliging friends i know they would give me them and such 
as the productions of those that have the highest reputation in our spain could not equal 
in short my friend i continued i am determined that senor don quixote shall remain buried 
in the archives of his own la mancha until heaven provide some one to garnish him with all 
those things he stands in need of because i find myself through my shallowness and want 
of learning unequal to supplying them and because i am by nature shy and careless about 
hunting for authors to say what i myself can say without them hence the cogitation and 
abstraction you found me in and reason enough what you have heard from me hearing this 
my friend giving himself a slap on the forehead and breaking into a hearty laugh exclaimed 
before god brother now am i disabused of an error in which i have been living all this long 
time i have known you all through which i have taken you to be shrewd and sensible in all 
you do but now i see you are as far from that as the heaven is from the earth it is possible 
that things of so little moment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit 
like yours fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles by my faith this comes 
not of any want of ability but of too much indolence and too little knowledge of life do 
you want to know if i am telling the truth well then attend to me and you will see how i can 
repeat it by rote he is to my eyes and thinking amiable brave courteous distinguished 
elegant fond gay honourable illustrious loyal manly noble open polite quickwitted 
rich and the ss according to the saying and then tender veracious x does not suit him for 
it is a rough letter y has been given already and z zealous for your honour camilla laughed 
at her maids alphabet and perceived her to be more experienced in love affairs than she 
said which she admitted confessing to camilla that she had love passages with a young 
man of good birth of the same city camilla was uneasy at this dreading lest it might prove 
the means of endangering her honour and asked whether her intrigue had gone beyond words 
and she with little shame and much effrontery said it had for certain it is that ladies 
imprudences make servants shameless who when they see their mistresses make a false 
step think nothing of going astray themselves or of its being known all that camilla could 
do was to entreat leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom she called her lover 
and to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of anselmo 
or of lothario leonela said she would but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed 
camillas apprehension of losing her reputation through her means for this abandoned 
and bold leonela as soon as she perceived that there were people there she asked in a low 
voice if we were nizarani as much as to say or ask if we were christians i answered that we 
were and begged her to come down as soon as she recognised me she did not delay an instant 
but without answering a word came down immediately opened the door and presented herself 
before us all so beautiful and so richly attired that i cannot attempt to describe her 
the moment i saw her i took her hand and kissed it and the renegade and my two comrades did 
the same and the rest who knew nothing of the circumstances did as they saw us do for it only 
seemed as if we were returning thanks to her and recognising her as the giver of our liberty 
the renegade asked her in the morisco language if her father was in the house she replied 
that he was and that he was asleep then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with 
us said the renegade and everything of value in this fair mansion nay said she my father 
must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must attack and fall upon 
them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible vanquish and destroy 
them even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish that they say are harder 
than diamonds and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of damascus steel or clubs 
studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more than once seen all this i say housekeeper 
that you may see the difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other and 
it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second or more 
properly speaking first kind of knightserrant for as we read in their histories there 
have been some among them who have been the salvation not merely of one kingdom but of many 
ah senor here exclaimed the niece remember that all this you are saying about knightserrant 
is fable and fiction and their histories if indeed they were not burned would deserve 
each of them to have a sambenito put on it or some mark by which it might be known as infamous 
and a corrupter of good manners by the god that gives me life said don quixote if thou wert 
not my full niece being daughter of my own sister i would inflict a chastisement upon thee 
for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with what can it be that 
a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lacebobbins dares to wag her tongue 
and criticise the histories of knightserrant what would senor amadis say if he heard 
of such a thing he however no doubt would forgive thee for he was the most humbleminded 
and courteous knight of his time and moreover a great protector of damsels but some there 
are that might have heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case for they 
are not all courteous or mannerly some are illconditioned scoundrels nor is it everyone 
that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects some are gold others pinchbeck 
and all look like gentlemen but not all can stand the touchstone of truth there are men 
of low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen and high gentlemen 
who one would fancy were dying to pass for men of low rank the former raise themselves by 
their ambition or by their virtues the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit 
or by their vices and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these 
two kinds of gentlemen so much alike in name and so different in conduct god bless me said 
the niece that you should know so much uncleenough if need be to get up into a pulpit and 
go preach in the streetsand yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly 
so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong when you are 
sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age and above 
all a caballero when you are not one for though gentlefolk may be so poor men are nothing 
of the kind there is a great deal of truth in what you say niece returned don quixote and 
i could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish you but not to mix up things human 
and divine i refrain look you my dears all the lineages in the world attend to what i am saying 
can be reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings and went 
on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness those 
that had great beginnings and maintained them and still maintain and uphold the greatness 
of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid 
having reduced and lessened their original greatness till it has come to nought like 
the point of a pyramid which relatively to its base or foundation is nothing and then there 
are thoseand it is they that are the most numerousthat have had neither an illustrious 
beginning nor a remarkable midcourse and so will have an end without a name like an ordinary 
plebeian line of the first those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they 
still preserve the ottoman house may serve as an example which from an humble and lowly 
shepherd its founder has reached the height at which we now see it for examples of the second 
sort of lineage that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it 
there are the many princes who have inherited the dignity and maintain themselves in 
their inheritance without increasing or diminishing it keeping peacefully within 
the limits of their states of those that began great and ended in a point there are thousands 
of examples for all the pharaohs and ptolemies of egypt the caesars of rome and the whole 
herd if i may such a word to them of countless princes monarchs lords medes assyrians persians 
greeks and barbarians all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come 
to nothing they themselves as well as their founders for it would be impossible now to 
find one of their descendants and even should we find one it would be in some lowly and humble 
condition of plebeian lineages i have nothing to say save that they merely serve to swell 
the number of those that live without any eminence to entitle them to any fame or praise 
beyond this from all i have said i would have you gather my poor innocents that great is 
the confusion among lineages and that only those are seen to be great and illustrious 
that show themselves so by the virtue wealth and generosity of their possessors i have 
said virtue wealth and generosity because a great man who is vicious will be a great example 
of vice and a rich man who is not generous will be merely a miserly beggar for the possessor 
of wealth is not made happy by possessing it but by spending it and not by spending as he 
pleases but by knowing how to spend it well the poor gentleman has no way of showing that 
he is a gentleman but by virtue by being affable wellbred courteous gentlemannered and 
kindly not haughty arrogant or censorious but above all by being charitable for by two 
maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he 
who distributes alms with bellringing and no one that perceives him to be endowed with 
the virtues i have named even though he know him not will fail to recognise and set him down 
as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times and he said to himself that two such lunatics 
as master and man the world had never seen in fine don quixote and sancho embraced one another 
and made friends and by the advice and with the approval of the great carrasco who was now 
their oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence 
by which time they could have all that was requisite for the journey ready and procure 
a closed helmet which don quixote said he must by all means take samson offered him one 
as he knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him though it was more dingy with 
rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel the curses which both housekeeper 
and niece poured out on the bachelor were past counting they tore their hair they clawed 
their faces and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion they raised 
a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle as if it had been his death samsons 
intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates 
farther on all by the advice of the curate and barber with whom he had previously discussed 
the subject finally then during those three days don quixote and sancho provided themselves 
with what they considered necessary and sancho having pacified his wife and don quixote 
his niece and housekeeper at nightfall unseen by anyone except the bachelor who thought 
fit to accompany them half a league out of the village they set out for el toboso don quixote 
on his good rocinante and sancho on his old dapple his alforjas furnished with certain 
matters in the way of victuals and his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet 
emergencies samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes 
whenever he had an opportunity and thus they bade each other farewell and sancho went 
away to make the necessary preparations for their expedition chapter v of the shrewd 
and droll conversation that passed between sancho panza and his wife teresa cascajo 
held the above irrelevant conversation don quixotes niece and housekeeper were not 
idle for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and master meant to 
give them the slip the third time and once more betake himself to his for them illerrant 
chivalry they strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up the bachelor bidding 
him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life for which he himself he said had already 
composed an eclogue that would take the shine out of all sannazaro had ever written and 
had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard the flock one called barcino and 
the other butron which a herdsman of quintanar had sold him but for all this don quixote 
could not shake off his sadness his friends called in the doctor who felt his pulse and 
was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape as he did not think it proper 
that an ape should divine anything either past or future so while master pedro was arranging 
the show he retired with sancho into a corner of the stable where without being overheard 
by anyone he said to him look here senor doctor for the future dont trouble yourself about 
giving me dainty things or choice dishes to eat for it will be only taking my stomach off 
its hinges it is accustomed to goat cow bacon hung beef turnips and onions and if by any 
chance it is given these palace dishes it receives them squeamishly and sometimes with 
loathing what the headcarver had best do is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas 
and the rottener they are the better they smell and he can put whatever he likes into them 
so long as it is good to eat and ill be obliged to him and will requite him some day but let 
nobody play pranks on me for either we are or we are not let us live and eat in peace and goodfellowship 
for when god sends the dawn he sends it for all i mean to govern this island without giving 
up a right or taking a bribe let everyone keep his eye open and look out for the arrow for 
i can tell them the devils in cantillana and if they drive me to it theyll see something 
that will astonish them nay make yourself honey and the flies eat you of a truth senor governor 
said the carver your worship is in the right of it in everything you have said and i promise 
you in the name of all the inhabitants of this island that they will serve your worship 
with all zeal affection and goodwill for the mild kind of government you have given a sample 
of to begin with leaves them no ground for doing or thinking anything to your worships 
disadvantage that i believe said sancho and they would be great fools if they did or thought 
otherwise once more i say see to my feeding and my dapples for that is the great point and 
what is most to the purpose and when the hour comes let us go the rounds for it is my intention 
to purge this island of all manner of uncleanness and of all idle goodfornothing vagabonds 
for i would have you know sir errant that in these little villages everything is talked 
about and everything is carped at and rest assured as i am that the priest must be over and 
above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him especially in villages that 
is the truth said don quixote and if i make no complaint of the pain it is because knightserrant 
are not permitted to complain of any wound even though their bowels be coming out through 
it if so said sancho i have nothing to say but god knows i would rather your worship complained 
when anything ailed you for my part i confess i must complain however small the ache may 
be unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knightserrant also 
don quixote could not help laughing at his squires simplicity and he assured him he might 
complain whenever and however he chose just as he liked for so far he had never read of anything 
to the contrary in the order of knighthood sancho bade him remember it was dinnertime 
to which his master answered that he wanted nothing himself just then but that he might 
eat when he had a mind with this permission sancho settled himself as comfortably as he 
could on his beast and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed away in them he jogged 
along behind his master munching deliberately and from time to time taking a pull at the 
bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in malaga might have envied and while he 
went on in this way gulping down draught after draught he never gave a thought to any of 
the promises his master had made him nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation 
going in quest of adventures however dangerous they might be finally they passed the 
night among some trees from one of which don quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after 
a fashion as a lance and fixed on it the head he had removed from the broken one all that night 
don quixote lay awake thinking of his lady dulcinea in order to conform to what he had read 
in his books how many a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported 
by the memory of their mistresses not so did sancho panza spend it for having his stomach 
full of something stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it and if his master 
had not called him neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes 
of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him on getting 
up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before which grieved 
his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily don 
quixote did not care to break his fast for as has been already said he confined himself 
to savoury recollections for nourishment they returned to the road they had set out with 
leading to puerto lapice and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it here brother 
sancho panza said don quixote when he saw it we may plunge our hands up to the elbows in what 
they call adventures but observe even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the 
world thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence unless indeed thou perceivest 
that those who assail me are rabble or base folk for in that case thou mayest very properly 
aid me but if they be knights it is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of 
knighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight most certainly senor replied 
sancho your worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter all the more as of myself i am peaceful 
and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels it is true that as regards the defence of 
my own person i shall not give much heed to those laws for laws human and divine allow each 
one to defend himself against any assailant whatever that i grant said don quixote but 
in this matter of aiding me against knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural 
impetuosity i will do so i promise you answered sancho and will keep this precept as carefully 
as sunday while they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the order 
of st benedict mounted on two dromedaries for not less tall were the two mules they rode 
on they wore travelling spectacles and carried sunshades and behind them came a coach 
attended by four or five persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot in the coach there 
was as afterwards appeared a biscay lady on her way to seville where her husband was about 
to take passage for the indies with an appointment of high honour the friars though going 
the same road were not in her company but the moment don quixote perceived them he said 
to his squire fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our 
desires ourselves for look there friend sancho panza where thirty or more monstrous 
giants present themselves all of whom i mean to engage in battle and slay and with whose 
spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes for this is righteous warfare and it is gods 
good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth what giants said sancho 
panza those thou seest there answered his master with the long arms and some have them 
nearly two leagues long look your worship said sancho what we see there are not giants 
but windmills and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the 
millstone go it is easy to see replied don quixote that thou art not used to this business 
of adventures those are giants and if thou art afraid away with thee out of this and betake 
thyself to prayer while i engage them in fierce and unequal combat so saying he gave the 
spur to his steed rocinante heedless of the cries his squire sancho sent after him warning 
him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack he however 
was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of sancho nor perceived 
near as he was what they were but made at them shouting fly not cowards and vile beings for 
a single knight attacks you a slight breeze at this moment sprang up and the great sails 
began to move seeing which don quixote exclaimed though ye flourish more arms than the 
giant briareus ye have to reckon with me so saying and commending himself with all his 
might and soul to his lady dulcinea he made up his mind to call himself don quixote whence 
as has been already said the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his 
name must have been beyond a doubt quixada and not quesada as others would have it recollecting 
however that the valiant amadis was not content to call himself curtly amadis and nothing 
more but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous and called himself 
amadis of gaul he like a good knight resolved to add on the name of his and to style himself 
don quixote of la mancha whereby he considered he described accurately his origin and 
country and did honour to it in taking his surname from it so then his armour being furbished 
his morion turned into a helmet his hack christened and he himself confirmed he came to 
the conclusion that his neighbour was mad and so made all haste to reach the village to 
escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of don quixotes who at the end of it said senor 
don rodrigo de narvaez your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won more 
than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite and god knows how i was there and 
gave more than one doubtful point in his favour very much against what my conscience told 
me he made off with his winnings and when i made sure he was going to give me a crown or so at 
least by way of a present as it is usual and customary to give men of quality of my sort who 
stand by to see fair or foul play and back up swindles and prevent quarrels he pocketed 
his money and left the house indignant at this i followed him and speaking him fairly and 
civilly asked him to give me if it were only eight reals for he knows i am an honest man and 
that i have neither profession nor property for my parents never brought me up to any or 
left me any but the rogue who is a greater thief than cacus and a greater sharper than andradilla 
would not give me more than four reals so your worship may see how little shame and conscience 
he has but by my faith if you had not come up id have made him disgorge his winnings and hed 
have learned what the range of the steelyard was what say you to this asked sancho the other 
replied that all his antagonist said was true and that he did not choose to give him more 
than four reals because he very often gave him money and that those who expected presents 
ought to be civil and take what is given them with a cheerful countenance and not make any 
claim against winners unless they know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings 
to be unfairly won and that there could be no better proof that he himself was an honest 
man than his having refused to give anything for sharpers always pay tribute to lookerson 
who know them that is true said the majordomo and i maintain that lycurgus himself who 
gave laws to the lacedemonians could not have pronounced a better decision than the great 
panza has given let the mornings audience close with this and i will see that the senor 
governor has dinner entirely to his liking thats all i ask forfair play said sancho give 
me my dinner and then let it rain cases and questions on me and ill despatch them in a twinkling 
the majordomo kept his word for he felt it against his conscience to kill so wise a governor 
by hunger particularly as he intended to have done with him that same night playing off 
the last joke he was commissioned to practise upon him it came to pass then that after he 
had dined that day in opposition to the rules and aphorisms of doctor tirteafuera as they 
were taking away the cloth there came a courier with a letter from don quixote for the governor 
sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself and if there was nothing in it that demanded 
secrecy to read it aloud the secretary did so and after he had skimmed the contents he said 
it may well be read aloud for what senor don quixote writes to your worship deserves to 
be printed or written in letters of gold and it is as follows don quixote of la manchas letter 
to sancho panza governor of the island of barataria squire that was to the famous knight 
don quixote of la mancha at the question a young girl who was washing stood up and said teresa 
panza is my mother and that sancho is my father and that knight is our master well then miss 
said the page come and show me where your mother is for i bring her a letter and a present 
from your father that i will with all my heart senor said sancho and let us return to our 
village with these gentlemen who seek your good and there we will prepare for making another 
sally which may turn out more profitable and creditable to us thou art right sancho returned 
don quixote it will be wise to let the malign influence of the stars which now prevails 
pass off the canon the curate and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing as 
he said and so highly amused at sancho panzas simplicities they placed don quixote in 
the cart as before the procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its 
road the goatherd took his leave of the party the officers of the brotherhood declined 
to go any farther and the curate paid them what was due to them the canon begged the curate 
to let him know how don quixote did whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered 
from it and then begged leave to continue his journey in short they all separated and went 
their ways leaving to themselves the curate and the barber don quixote sancho panza and 
the good rocinante who regarded everything with as great resignation as his master the 
carter yoked his oxen and made don quixote comfortable on a truss of hay and at his usual 
deliberate pace took the road the curate directed and at the end of six days they reached 
don quixotes village and entered it about the middle of the day which it so happened was 
a sunday and the people were all in the plaza through which don quixotes cart passed they 
all flocked to see what was in the cart and when they recognised their townsman they were 
filled with amazement and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece 
that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of 
hay on an oxcart it was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised how they beat 
their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of chivalry 
all which was renewed when they saw don quixote coming in at the gate at the news of don quixotes 
arrival sancho panzas wife came running for she by this time knew that her husband had 
gone away with him as his squire and on seeing sancho the first thing she asked him was if 
the ass was well sancho replied that he was better than his master was thanks be to god said 
she for being so good to me but now tell me my friend what have you made by your squirings 
what gown have you brought me back what shoes for your children i bring nothing of that 
sort wife said sancho though i bring other things of more consequence and value i am very 
glad of that returned his wife show me these things of more value and consequence my friend 
for i want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that 
you have been away i will show them to you at home wife said sancho be content for the present 
for if it please god that we should again go on our travels in search of adventures you will 
soon see me a count or governor of an island and that not one of those everyday ones but the 
best that is to be had heaven grant it husband said she for indeed we have need of it but tell 
me whats this about islands for i dont understand it honey is not for the mouth of the ass 
returned sancho all in good time thou shalt see wifenay thou wilt be surprised to hear 
thyself called your ladyship by all thy vassals what are you talking about sancho with 
your ladyships islands and vassals returned teresa panzafor so sanchos wife was called 
though they were not relations for in la mancha it is customary for wives to take their 
husbands surnames dont be in such a hurry to know all this teresa said sancho it is enough 
that i am telling you the truth for i assure you senor and in good part be it said hunger and 
the loss of your grinders have given you such an illfavoured face that as i say the rueful 
picture may be very well spared don quixote laughed at sanchos pleasantry nevertheless 
he resolved to call himself by that name and have his shield or buckler painted as he had 
devised don quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter were bones 
or not but sancho would not have it saying senor you have ended this perilous adventure 
more safely for yourself than any of those i have seen perhaps these people though beaten 
and routed may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten them and feeling 
sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in search of us and give us trouble enough 
the ass is in proper trim the mountains are near at hand hunger presses we have nothing 
more to do but make good our retreat and as the saying is the dead to the grave and the living 
to the loaf and driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow who feeling that 
sancho was right did so without replying and after proceeding some little distance between 
two hills they found themselves in a wide and retired valley where they alighted and sancho 
unloaded his beast and stretched upon the green grass with hunger for sauce they breakfasted 
dined lunched and supped all at once satisfying their appetites with more than one store 
of cold meat which the dead mans clerical gentlemen who seldom put themselves on short 
allowance had brought with them on their sumpter mule but another piece of illluck befell 
them which sancho held the worst of all and that was that they had no wine to drink nor even 
water to moisten their lips and as thirst tormented them sancho observing that the meadow 
where they were was full of green and tender grass said what will be told in the following 
chapter chapter xxix of the famous adventure of the enchanted bark by stages as already 
described or left undescribed two days after quitting the grove don quixote and sancho 
reached the river ebro and the sight of it was a great delight to don quixote as he contemplated 
and gazed upon the charms of its banks the clearness of its stream the gentleness of its 
current and the abundance of its crystal waters and the pleasant view revived a thousand 
tender thoughts in his mind above all he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of montesinos 
for though master pedros ape had told him that of those things part was true part false 
he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood the very reverse of sancho who held 
them all to be downright lies as they were thus proceeding then they discovered a small 
boat without oars or any other gear that lay at the waters edge tied to the stem of a tree 
growing on the bank don quixote looked all round and seeing nobody at once without more 
ado dismounted from rocinante and bade sancho get down from dapple and tie both beasts 
securely to the trunk of a poplar or willow that stood there sancho asked him the reason 
of this sudden dismounting and tying don quixote made answer thou must know sancho that 
this bark is plainly and without the possibility of any alternative calling and inviting 
me to enter it and in it go to give aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need 
of it who is no doubt in some sore strait for this is the way of the books of chivalry and of 
the enchanters who figure and speak in them when a knight is involved in some difficulty 
from which he cannot be delivered save by the hand of another knight though they may be 
at a distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other they either take 
him up on a cloud or they provide a bark for him to get into and in less than the twinkling 
of an eye they carry him where they will and where his help is required and so sancho this 
bark is placed here for the same purpose this is as true as that it is daylight now and if 
it be a lie it must be a lie too that there was a hector or achilles or trojan war or twelve 
peers of france or arthur of england who still lives changed into a raven and is unceasingly 
looked for in his kingdom one might just as well try to make out that the history of guarino 
mezquino or of the quest of the holy grail is false or that the loves of tristram and the 
queen yseult are apocryphal as well as those of guinevere and lancelot when there are 
persons who can almost remember having seen the dame quintanona who was the best cupbearer 
in great britain and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained two 
years on rocks in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven without their 
ladies knowing anything of it and one of these was amadis when under the name of beltenebros 
he took up his abode on the pena pobre fori know not if it was eight years or eight months 
for i am not very sure of the reckoning at any rate he stayed there doing penance for i know 
not what pique the princess oriana had against him but no more of this now sancho and make 
haste before a mishap like rocinantes befalls the ass the very devil would be in it in that 
case said sancho and letting off thirty ohs and sixty sighs and a hundred and twenty maledictions 
and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there he raised himself stopping 
halfway bent like a turkish bow without power to bring himself upright but with all his 
pains he saddled his ass who too had gone astray somewhat yielding to the excessive licence 
of the day he next raised up rocinante and as for him had he possessed a tongue to complain 
with most assuredly neither sancho nor his master would have been behind him to be brief 
sancho fixed don quixote on the ass and secured rocinante with a leading rein and taking 
the ass by the halter he proceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him 
the high road might be and as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to 
better he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight and on it he perceived an 
inn which to his annoyance and to the delight of don quixote must needs be a castle sancho 
insisted that it was an inn and his master that it was not one but a castle and the dispute 
lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it and into it sancho 
entered with all his team without any further controversy chapter xvi of what happened 
to the ingenious gentleman in the inn which he took to be a castle the innkeeper seeing 
don quixote slung across the ass asked sancho what was amiss with him sancho answered 
that it was nothing only that he had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised 
the innkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly 
have for she was by nature kindhearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours so 
she at once set about tending don quixote and made her young daughter a very comely girl 
help her in taking care of her guest there was besides in the inn as servant an asturian 
lass with a broad face flat poll and snub nose blind of one eye and not very sound in the other 
the elegance of her shape to be sure made up for all her defects she did not measure seven 
palms from head to foot and her shoulders which overweighted her somewhat made her contemplate 
the ground more than she liked this graceful lass then helped the young girl and the two 
made up a very bad bed for don quixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly 
served for many years as a strawloft in which there was also quartered a carrier whose 
bed was placed a little beyond our don quixotes and though only made of the packsaddles 
and cloths of his mules had much the advantage of it as don quixotes consisted simply of 
four rough boards on two not very even trestles a mattress that for thinness might have 
passed for a quilt full of pellets which were they not seen through the rents to be wool 
would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness two sheets made of buckler leather 
and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without missing 
one in the reckoning on this accursed bed don quixote stretched himself and the hostess 
and her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe while maritornesfor that 
was the name of the gentleman i have referred to and so with my help as gobetween he found 
his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived antonomasia deceived not by him but 
by me under the title of a lawful husband for sinner though i was would not have allowed 
him to approach the edge of her shoesole without being her husband no no not that marriage 
must come first in any business of this sort that i take in hand but there was one hitch in 
this case which was that of inequality of rank don clavijo being a private gentleman and 
the princess antonomasia as i said heiress to the kingdom the entanglement remained 
for some time a secret kept hidden by my cunning precautions until i perceived that a certain 
expansion of waist in antonomasia must before long disclose it the dread of which made 
us all there take counsel together and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light 
don clavijo should demand antonomasia as his wife before the vicar in virtue of an agreement 
to marry him made by the princess and drafted by my wit in such binding terms that the might 
of samson could not have broken it the necessary steps were taken the vicar saw the agreement 
and took the ladys confession she confessed everything in full and he ordered her into 
the custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court are there alguacils of the court in kandy 
too said sancho at this and poets and seguidillas i swear i think the world is the same all 
over but make haste senora trifaldi for it is late and i am dying to know the end of this long 
story i will replied the countess chapter xxxix in which the trifaldi continues her marvellous 
and memorable story by every word that sancho uttered the duchess was as much delighted 
as don quixote was driven to desperation he bade him hold his tongue and the distressed 
one went on to say at length after much questioning and answering as the princess held 
to her story without changing or varying her previous declaration the vicar gave his 
decision in favour of don clavijo and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife which 
the queen dona maguncia the princess antonomasias mother so took to heart that within 
the space of three days we buried her she died no doubt said sancho of course said trifaldin 
they dont bury living people in kandy only the dead senor squire said sancho a man in a swoon 
has been known to be buried before now in the belief that he was dead and it struck me that 
queen maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died because with life a great many things 
come right and the princesss folly was not so great that she need feel it so keenly if the 
lady had married some page of hers or some other servant of the house as many another has 
done so i have heard say then the mischief would have been past curing but to marry such 
an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been just now described to usindeed indeed 
though it was a folly it was not such a great one as you think for according to the rules of 
my master hereand he wont allow me to lieas of men of letters bishops are made so of gentlemen 
knights specially if they be errant kings and emperors may be made thou art right sancho 
said don quixote for this painter is like orbaneja a painter there was at ubeda who when 
they asked him what he was painting used to say whatever it may turn out and if he chanced 
to paint a cock he would write under it this is a cock for fear they might think it was a fox 
the painter or writer for its all the same who published the history of this new don quixote 
that has come out must have been one of this sort i think sancho for he painted or wrote whatever 
it might turn out or perhaps he is like a poet called mauleon that was about the court some 
years ago who used to answer at haphazard whatever he was asked and on one asking him what 
deum de deo meant he replied de donde diere but putting this aside tell me sancho hast thou 
a mind to have another turn at thyself tonight and wouldst thou rather have it indoors 
or in the open air egad senor said sancho for what im going to give myself it comes all the 
same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields still id like it to be among trees for i 
think they are company for me and help me to bear my pain wonderfully and yet it must not 
be sancho my friend said don quixote support life which is of more consequence to thee 
than to me and leave me to die under the pain of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes 
i was born sancho to live dying and thou to die eating and to prove the truth of what he said 
he told us briefly what had happened to a certain christian gentleman almost at that very 
time the strangest case that had ever occurred even there where astonishing and marvellous 
things are happening every instant in short he ended by saying that what could and ought 
to be done was to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us christians to him so 
that he might with it buy a vessel there in algiers under the pretence of becoming a merchant 
and trader at tetuan and along the coast and when master of the vessel it would be easy for 
him to hit on some way of getting us all out of the bano and putting us on board especially 
if the moorish lady gave as she said money enough to ransom all because once free it would 
be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark even in open day but the greatest difficulty 
was that the moors do not allow any renegade to buy or own any craft unless it be a large vessel 
for going on roving expeditions because they are afraid that anyone who buys a small vessel 
especially if he be a spaniard only wants it for the purpose of escaping to christian territory 
this however he could get over by arranging with a tagarin moor to go shares with him in 
the purchase of the vessel and in the profit on the cargo and under cover of this he could 
become master of the vessel in which case he looked upon all the rest as accomplished but 
though to me and my comrades it had seemed a better plan to send to majorca for the vessel 
as the moorish lady suggested we did not dare to oppose him fearing that if we did not do 
as he said he would denounce us and place us in danger of losing all our lives if he were to 
disclose our dealings with zoraida for whose life we would have all given our own we therefore 
resolved to put ourselves in the hands of god and in the renegades and at the same time an 
answer was given to zoraida telling her that we would do all she recommended for she had 
given as good advice as if lela marien had delivered it and that it depended on her alone 
whether we were to defer the business or put it in execution at once i renewed my promise 
to be her husband and thus the next day that the bano chanced to be empty she at different 
times gave us by means of the reed and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which 
she said that the next juma that is to say friday she was going to her fathers garden but 
that before she went she would give us more money and if it were not enough we were to let 
her know as she would give us as much as we asked for her father had so much he would not miss 
it and besides she kept all the keys we at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to 
buy the vessel and with eight hundred i ransomed myself giving the money to a valencian 
merchant who happened to be in algiers at the time and who had me released on his word pledging 
it that on the arrival of the first ship from valencia he would pay my ransom for if he had 
given the money at once it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been 
for a long time in algiers and that the merchant had for his own advantage kept it secret 
in fact my master was so difficult to deal with that i dared not on any account pay down the 
money at once the thursday before the friday on which the fair zoraida was to go to the garden 
she gave us a thousand crowns more and warned us of her departure begging me if i were ransomed 
to find out her fathers garden at once and by all means to seek an opportunity of going there 
to see her i answered in a few words that i would do so and that she must remember to commend 
us to lela marien with all the prayers the captive had taught her this having been done 
steps were taken to ransom our three comrades so as to enable them to quit the bano and lest 
seeing me ransomed and themselves not though the money was forthcoming they should make 
a disturbance about it and the devil should prompt them to do something that might injure 
zoraida for though their position might be sufficient to relieve me from this apprehension 
nevertheless i was unwilling to run any risk in the matter and so i had them ransomed in 
the same way as i was handing over all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety 
and confidence give security without however confiding our arrangement and secret 
to him which might have been dangerous chapter xli in which the captive still continues 
his adventures before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an excellent 
vessel with room for more than thirty persons and to make the transaction safe and lend 
a colour to it he thought it well to make as he did a voyage to a place called shershel twenty 
leagues from algiers on the oran side where there is an extensive trade in dried figs two 
or three times he made this voyage in company with the tagarin already mentioned the moors 
of aragon are called tagarins in barbary and those of granada mudejars but in the kingdom 
of fez they call the mudejars elches and they are the people the king chiefly employs in 
war to proceed every time he passed with his vessel he anchored in a cove that was not two 
crossbow shots from the garden where zoraida was waiting and there the renegade together 
with the two moorish lads that rowed used purposely to station himself either going through 
his prayers or else practising as a part what he meant to perform in earnest and thus he 
would go to zoraidas garden and ask for fruit which her father gave him not knowing him 
but though as he afterwards told me he sought to speak to zoraida and tell her who he was 
and that by my orders he was to take her to the land of the christians and there buy a vessel 
and come back for the others and he will find me in my fathers garden which is at the babazon 
gate near the seashore where i shall be all this summer with my father and my servants you 
can carry me away from there by night without any danger and bring me to the vessel and remember 
thou art to be my husband else i will pray to marien to punish thee if thou canst not trust 
anyone to go for the vessel ransom thyself and do thou go for i know thou wilt return more 
surely than any other as thou art a gentleman and a christian endeavour to make thyself 
acquainted with the garden and when i see thee walking yonder i shall know that the bano 
is empty and i will give thee abundance of money allah protect thee senor these were the 
words and contents of the second paper and on hearing them each declared himself willing 
to be the ransomed one and promised to go and return with scrupulous good faith and i too 
made the same offer but to all this the renegade objected saying that he would not on any 
account consent to one being set free before all went together as experience had taught 
him how ill those who have been set free keep promises which they made in captivity for 
captives of distinction frequently had recourse to this plan paying the ransom of one 
who was to go to valencia or majorca with money to enable him to arm a bark and return for 
the others who had ransomed him but who never came back for recovered liberty and the dread 
of losing it again efface from the memory all the obligations in the world and to prove 
the truth of what i say if your highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days 
to which the duchess made answer that worthy sancho is droll i consider a very good thing 
because it is a sign that he is shrewd for drollery and sprightliness senor don quixote 
as you very well know do not take up their abode with dull wits and as good sancho is droll 
and sprightly i here set him down as shrewd and talkative added don quixote so much the 
better said the duke for many droll things cannot be said in few words but not to lose time 
in talking come great knight of the rueful countenance of the lions your highness must 
say said sancho for there is no rueful countenance nor any such character now he of the 
lions be it continued the duke i say let sir knight of the lions come to a castle of mine close 
by where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage and which 
the duchess and i are wont to give to all knightserrant who come there by this time sancho 
had fixed and girthed rocinantes saddle and don quixote having got on his back and the 
duke mounted a fine horse they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle 
the duchess desired sancho to come to her side for she found infinite enjoyment in listening 
to his shrewd remarks sancho required no pressing but pushed himself in between them 
and the duke who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knighterrant and such a 
homely squire in their castle chapter xxxi which treats of many and great matters supreme 
was the satisfaction that sancho felt at seeing himself as it seemed an established favourite 
with the duchess for he looked forward to finding in her castle what he had found in don 
diegos house and in basilios he was always fond of good living and always seized by the 
forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented itself the history 
informs us then that before they reached the country house or castle the duke went on in 
advance and instructed all his servants how they were to treat don quixote so that he might 
see and believe they were treating him like a knighterrant when his armour was removed 
there stood don quixote in his tightfitting breeches and chamois doublet lean lanky 
and long with cheeks that seemed to be kissing each other inside such a figure that if the 
damsels waiting on him had not taken care to check their merriment which was one of the 
particular directions their master and mistress had given them they would have burst 
with laughter they asked him to let himself be stripped that they might put a shirt on him 
but he would not on any account saying that modesty became knightserrant just as much 
as valour however he said they might give the shirt to sancho and shutting himself in with 
him in a room where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers the duchess and 
the duke came out to the door of the room and posted themselves so close to it that they could 
hear all that was said inside but when the duchess heard how the rodriguez had made public 
the aranjuez of her issues she could not restrain herself nor altisidora either and so 
filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance they burst into the room and tormented don 
quixote and flogged the duenna in the manner already described for indignities offered 
to their charms and selfesteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager 
for revenge the duchess told the duke what had happened and he was much amused by it and 
she in pursuance of her design of making merry and diverting herself with don quixote 
despatched the page who had played the part of dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment 
which sancho panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about to teresa panza 
his wife with her husbands letter and another from herself and also a great string of fine 
coral beads as a present now the history says this page was very sharp and quickwitted 
and eager to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for sanchos village before 
he entered it he observed a number of women washing in a brook and asked them if they could 
tell him whether there lived there a woman of the name of teresa panza wife of one sancho 
panza squire to a knight called don quixote of la mancha and made him confess that my casildea 
is more beautiful than his dulcinea and in this one victory i hold myself to have conquered 
all the knights in the world for this don quixote that i speak of has vanquished them all 
and i having vanquished him his glory his fame and his honour have passed and are transferred 
to my person for the more the vanquished hath of fair renown the greater glory gilds the 
victors crown thus the innumerable achievements of the said don quixote are now set down 
to my account and have become mine don quixote was amazed when he heard the knight of the 
grove and him of the rueful countenance chapter xiv wherein is continued the adventure 
of the knight of the grove together with the sensible original and tranquil colloquy 
that passed between the two squires the knights and the squires made two parties these 
telling the story of their lives the others the story of their loves but the history relates 
first of all the conversation of the servants and afterwards takes up that of the masters 
and it says that withdrawing a little from the others he of the grove said to sancho a hard 
life it is we lead and live senor we that are squires to knightserrant verily we eat our 
bread in the sweat of our faces which is one of the curses god laid on our first parents it 
may be said too added sancho that we eat it in the chill of our bodies for who gets more heat 
and cold than the miserable squires of knighterrantry even so it would not be so bad but 
thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of all who have anything to do with thee 
or say to thee why look at these gentlemen bearing thee company get thee home blockhead 
and see after thy affairs and thy wife and children and give over these fooleries that 
are sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits go your own way brother said don antonio 
and dont offer advice to those who dont ask you for it senor don quixote is in his full senses 
and we who bear him company are not fools virtue is to be honoured wherever it may be found 
go and bad luck to you and dont show your face in all this island or within six leagues of 
it on any side under pain of two hundred lashes be off at once i say you shameless cheating 
shrew the woman was cowed and went off disconsolately hanging her head and the governor 
said to the man honest man go home with your money and god speed you and for the future if 
you dont want to lose it see that you dont take it into your head to yoke with anybody the 
man thanked him as clumsily as he could and went his way and the bystanders were again filled 
with admiration at their new governors judgments and sentences next two men one apparently 
a farm labourer and the other a tailor for he had a pair of shears in his hand presented themselves 
before him and the tailor said senor governor this labourer and i come before your worship 
by reason of this honest man coming to my shop yesterday for saving everybodys presence 
im a passed tailor god be thanked and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me 
senor will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap measuring the cloth i said there 
would he probably suspectedas i supposed and i supposed rightthat i wanted to steal some 
of the cloth led to think so by his own roguery and the bad opinion people have of tailors 
and he told me to see if there would be enough for two i guessed what he would be at and i said 
yes he still following up his original unworthy notion went on adding cap after cap and 
i yes after yes until we got as far as five he has just this moment come for them i gave them 
to him but he wont pay me for the making on the contrary he calls upon me to pay him or else 
return his cloth is all this true brother said sancho yes replied the man but will your 
worship make him show the five caps he has made me with all my heart said the gentleman that 
on the goletta runs thus chapter xl in which the story of the captive is continued sonnet 
blest souls that from this mortal husk set free in guerdon of brave deeds beatified above 
this lowly orb of ours abide made heirs of heaven and immortality with noble rage and ardour 
glowing ye your strength while strength was yours in battle plied and with your own blood 
and the foemans dyed the sandy soil and the encircling sea it was the ebbing lifeblood 
first that failed the weary arms the stout hearts never quailed though vanquished yet 
ye earned the victors crown though mourned yet still triumphant was your fall for there 
ye won between the sword and wall in heaven glory and on earth renown that is it exactly 
according to my recollection said the captive well then that on the fort said the gentleman 
if my memory serves me goes thus sonnet up from this wasted soil this shattered shell whose 
walls and towers here in ruin lie three thousand soldier souls took wing on high in the 
bright mansions of the blest to dwell the onslaught of the foeman to repel by might of arm 
all vainly did they try and when at length twas left them but to die wearied and few the last 
defenders fell and this same arid soil hath ever been a haunt of countless mournful memories 
as well in our day as in days of yore but never yet to heaven it sent i ween from its hard bosom 
purer souls than these or braver bodies on its surface bore the sonnets were not disliked 
and the captive was rejoiced at the tidings they gave him of his comrade and continuing 
his tale he went on to say the goletta and the fort being thus in their hands the turks gave 
orders to dismantle the golettafor the fort was reduced to such a state that there was 
nothing left to leveland to do the work more quickly and easily they mined it in three places 
but nowhere were they able to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong that is 
to say the old walls while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that the 
fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease finally the fleet returned victorious 
and triumphant to constantinople and a few months later died my master el uchali otherwise 
uchali fartax which means in turkish the scabby renegade for that he was it is the practice 
with the turks to name people from some defect or virtue they may possess the reason being 
that there are among them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their descent 
from the ottoman house and the others as i have said take their names and surnames either 
from bodily blemishes or moral qualities this scabby one rowed at the oar as a slave of 
the grand signors for fourteen years and when over thirtyfour years of age in resentment 
at having been struck by a turk while at the oar turned renegade and renounced his faith 
in order to be able to cure him when he falls sick the chief thing i have to do is to attend 
at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to be fit for him and keep 
from him what i think will do him harm and be injurious to his stomach and therefore i ordered 
that plate of fruit to be removed as being too hot and containing many spices that stimulate 
thirst for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists 
well then said sancho that dish of roast partridges there that seems so savoury will not 
do me any harm to this the physician replied of those my lord the governor shall not eat 
so long as i live why so said sancho because replied the doctor our master hippocrates 
the polestar and beacon of medicine says in one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala 
perdicis autem pessima which means all repletion is bad but that of partridge is the worst 
of all in that case said sancho let senor doctor see among the dishes that are on the table 
what will do me most good and least harm and let me eat it without tapping it with his stick 
for by the life of the governor and so may god suffer me to enjoy it but im dying of hunger 
and in spite of the doctor and all he may say to deny me food is the way to take my life instead 
of prolonging it your worship is right senor governor said the physician and therefore 
your worship i consider should not eat of those stewed rabbits there because it is a furry 
kind of food if that veal were not roasted and served with pickles you might try it but it 
is out of the question that big dish that is smoking farther off said sancho seems to me 
to be an olla podrida and out of the diversity of things in such ollas i cant fail to light 
upon something tasty and good for me absit said the doctor far from us be any such base thought 
there is nothing in the world less nourishing than an olla podrida to canons or rectors 
of colleges or peasants weddings with your ollas podridas but let us have none of them 
on the tables of governors where everything that is present should be delicate and refined 
and the reason is that always everywhere and by everybody simple medicines are more esteemed 
than compound ones for we cannot go wrong in those that are simple while in the compound 
we may by merely altering the quantity of the things composing them but what i am of opinion 
the governor should cat now in order to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or 
so of wafer cakes and a few thin slices of conserve of quinces which will settle his stomach 
and help his digestion sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed 
the doctor steadily and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was and where he had studied 
he replied my name senor governor is doctor pedro recio de aguero i am a native of a place 
called tirteafuera which lies between caracuel and almodovar del campo on the righthand 
side and i have the degree of doctor from the university of osuna to which sancho glowing 
all over with rage returned then let doctor pedro recio de malaguero native of tirteafuera 
a place thats on the righthand side as we go from caracuel to almodovar del campo graduate 
of osuna get out of my presence at once or i swear by the sun ill take a cudgel and by dint of 
blows beginning with him ill not leave a doctor in the whole island at least of those i know 
to be ignorant for as to learned wise sensible physicians them i will reverence and honour 
as divine persons once more i say let pedro recio get out of this or ill take this chair i 
am sitting on and break it over his head and if they call me to account for it ill clear myself 
by saying i served god in killing a bad doctora general executioner and now give me something 
to eat or else take your government for a trade that does not feed its master is not worth 
two beans the doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion and he would 
have made a tirteafuera out of the room but that the same instant a posthorn sounded in 
the street and the carver putting his head out of the window turned round and said its a 
courier from my lord the duke no doubt with some despatch of importance the courier came 
in all sweating and flurried and taking a paper from his bosom placed it in the governors 
hands sancho handed it to the majordomo and bade him read the superscription which ran 
thus to don sancho panza governor of the island of barataria squire that was to the famous 
knight don quixote of la mancha who rights wrongs gives food to those who thirst and drink 
to the hungry thats all very well but do you know her house sancho my master says it will 
be some royal palace or grand castle and have you ever seen her by any chance neither i nor 
my master ever saw her and does it strike you that it would be just and right if the el toboso 
people finding out that you were here with the intention of going to tamper with their 
princesses and trouble their ladies were to come and cudgel your ribs and not leave a whole 
bone in you they would indeed have very good reason if they did not see that i am under orders 
and that you are a messenger my friend no blame belongs to you dont you trust to that sancho 
for the manchegan folk are as hottempered as they are honest and wont put up with liberties 
from anybody by the lord if they get scent of you it will be worse for you i promise you be 
off you scoundrel let the bolt fall why should i go looking for three feet on a cat tis you 
that are the cat rat and rascal replied don quixote and acting on the word he fell upon him 
so suddenly that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground 
sorely wounded with a lancethrust and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the 
musket the other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected event but 
recovering presence of mind those on horseback seized their swords and those on foot 
their javelins and attacked don quixote who was waiting for them with great calmness 
and no doubt it would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves seeing the chance before 
them of liberating themselves had not effected it by contriving to break the chain on 
which they were strung such was the confusion that the guards now rushing at the galley 
slaves who were breaking loose now to attack don quixote who was waiting for them did nothing 
at all that was of any use sancho on his part gave a helping hand to release gines de pasamonte 
who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered and who attacking the 
prostrate commissary took from him his sword and the musket with which aiming at one and 
levelling at another he without ever discharging it drove every one of the guards off 
the field for they took to flight as well to escape pasamontes musket as the showers of 
stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them sancho was greatly grieved 
at the affair because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to 
the holy brotherhood who at the summons of the alarmbell would at once sally forth in quest 
of the offenders and he said so to his master and entreated him to leave the place at once 
and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by that is all very well said don quixote 
but i know that he is not to blame for what has happened with this he pacified them and again 
asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find cardenio as he felt the greatest anxiety 
to know the end of his story the goatherd told him as he had told him before that there was 
no knowing of a certainty where his lair was but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood 
he could not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses chapter xxv which treats 
of the strange things that happened to the stout knight of la mancha in the sierra morena 
and of his imitation of the penance of beltenebros don quixote took leave of the goatherd 
and once more mounting rocinante bade sancho follow him which he having no ass did very 
discontentedly they proceeded slowly making their way into the most rugged part of the 
range lay they told me that it was in this quarter and i at once directed my course hither 
intending to end my life here but as i was making my way among these crags my mule dropped 
dead through fatigue and hunger or as i think more likely in order to have done with such 
a worthless burden as it bore in me i was left on foot worn out famishing without anyone 
to help me or any thought of seeking help and so thus i lay stretched on the ground how long 
i know not after which i rose up free from hunger and found beside me some goatherds who 
no doubt were the persons who had relieved me in my need for they told me how they had found 
me and how i had been uttering ravings that showed plainly i had lost my reason and since 
then i am conscious that i am not always in full possession of it but at times so deranged 
and crazed that i do a thousand mad things tearing my clothes crying aloud in these solitudes 
cursing my fate and idly calling on the dear name of her who is my enemy and only seeking 
to end my life in lamentation and when i recover my senses i find myself so exhausted and 
weary that i can scarcely move most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork tree large 
enough to shelter this miserable body the herdsmen and goatherds who frequent these 
mountains moved by compassion furnish me with food leaving it by the wayside or on the 
rocks where they think i may perhaps pass and find it and so even though i may be then out 
of my senses the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain me and make me crave 
it and eager to take it at other times so they tell me when they find me in a rational mood 
i sally out upon the road and though they would gladly give it me i snatch food by force from 
the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts thus do pass the wretched life 
that remains to me until it be heavens will to bring it to a close or so to order my memory 
that i no longer recollect the beauty and treachery of luscinda or the wrong done me by 
don fernando for if it will do this without depriving me of life i will turn my thoughts 
into some better channel if not i can only implore it to have full mercy on my soul for in 
myself i feel no power or strength to release my body from this strait in which i have of 
my own accord chosen to place it such sirs is the dismal story of my misfortune say if it 
be one that can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me and do not trouble yourselves 
with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests as likely to serve for my relief for 
it will avail me as much as the medicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick 
man who will not take it i have no wish for health without luscinda and since it is her pleasure 
to be anothers when she is or should be mine let it be mine to be a prey to misery when i might 
have enjoyed happiness she by her fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable i will 
strive to gratify her wishes by seeking destruction and it will show generations to come 
that i alone was deprived of that of which all others in misfortune have a superabundance 
for to them the impossibility of being consoled is itself a consolation while to me it 
is the cause of greater sorrows and sufferings for i think that even in death there will 
not be an end of them here cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story as full 
of misfortune as it was of love but just as the curate was going to address some words of 
comfort to him he was stopped by a voice that reached his ear saying in melancholy tones 
what will be told in the following chapter chapter xix of the shrewd discourse which sancho 
held with his master and of the adventure that befell him with a dead body together with 
other notable occurrences it seems to me senor that all these mishaps that have befallen 
us of late have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed by your worship 
against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you made not to eat bread off a tablecloth 
and other trifling matters which he added until he had avenged him and i will make the same 
to take no rest and to roam the seven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the infante 
don pedro of portugal ever roamed them until i have disenchanted her all that and more 
you owe my lady the damsels answer to me and taking the four reals instead of making me a 
curtsey she cut a caper springing two full yards into the air o blessed god exclaimed sancho 
aloud at this is it possible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin 
and that not a packsaddle but as i perceive that they do assert and declare it i can only 
come to the conclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed 
to the evidence of experience and truth itself for i swear byand here he rapped out a round 
oathall the people in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness he is a madman 
full of streaks full of lucid intervals they went in to dinner and the repast was such as 
don diego said on the road he was in the habit of giving to his guests neat plentiful and 
tasty but what pleased don quixote most was the marvellous silence that reigned throughout 
the house for it was like a carthusian monastery when the cloth had been removed grace 
said and their hands washed don quixote earnestly pressed don lorenzo to repeat to him 
his verses for the poetical tournament to which he replied not to be like those poets who 
when they are asked to recite their verses refuse and when they are not asked for them vomit 
them up i will repeat my gloss for which i do not expect any prize having composed it merely 
as an exercise of ingenuity a discerning friend of mine said don quixote was of opinion 
that no one ought to waste labour in glossing verses and the reason he gave was that the 
gloss can never come up to the text and that often or most frequently it wanders away from 
the meaning and purpose aimed at in the glossed lines and besides that the laws of the gloss 
were too strict as they did not allow interrogations nor said he nor i say nor turning verbs 
into nouns or altering the construction not to speak of other restrictions and limitations 
that fetter glosswriters as you no doubt know verily senor don quixote said don lorenzo 
i wish i could catch your worship tripping at a stretch but i cannot for you slip through 
my fingers like an eel i dont understand what you say or mean by slipping said don quixote 
i will explain myself another time said don lorenzo for the present pray attend to the 
glossed verses and the gloss which run thus could was become an is for me then would i ask 
no more than this or could for me the time that is become the time that is to be when don lorenzo 
had finished reciting his gloss don quixote stood up and in a loud voice almost a shout 
exclaimed as he grasped don lorenzos right hand in his by the highest heavens noble youth 
but you are the best poet on earth and deserve to be crowned with laurel not by cyprus or 
by gaetaas a certain poet god forgive him saidbut by the academies of athens if they still 
flourished and by those that flourish now paris bologna salamanca heaven grant that 
the judges who rob you of the first prizethat phoebus may pierce them with his arrows and 
the muses never cross the thresholds of their doors repeat me some of your longmeasure 
verses senor if you will be so good for i want thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius 
is there any need to say that don lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised by don quixote 
albeit he looked upon him as a madman power of flattery how farreaching art thou and how 
wide are the bounds of thy pleasant jurisdiction don lorenzo gave a proof of it for he complied 
with don quixotes request and entreaty and repeated to him this sonnet on the fable or 
story of pyramus and thisbe sonnet the lovely maid she pierces now the wall heartpierced 
by her young pyramus doth lie and love spreads wing from cyprus isle to fly a chink to view 
so wondrous great and small there silence speaketh for no voice at all can pass so strait 
a strait but love will ply where to all other power twere vain to try for love will find a 
way whateer befall impatient of delay with reckless pace the rash maid wins the fatal 
spot where she sinks not in lovers arms but deaths embrace so runs the strange tale how 
the lovers twain one sword one sepulchre one memory slays and entombs and brings to life 
again blessed be god said don quixote when he had heard don lorenzos sonnet that among 
the hosts there are of irritable poets i have found one consummate one which senor the 
art of this sonnet proves to me that you are for four days was don quixote most sumptuously 
entertained in don diegos house at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope 
again with great ease and without feeling any weight which made them fancy don quixote 
was remaining below and persuaded that it was so sancho wept bitterly and hauled away 
in great haste in order to settle the question when however they had come to as it seemed 
rather more than eighty fathoms they felt a weight at which they were greatly delighted 
and at last at ten fathoms more they saw don quixote distinctly and sancho called out to 
him saying welcome back senor for we had begun to think you were going to stop there to found 
a family but don quixote answered not a word and drawing him out entirely they perceived 
he had his eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep they stretched him on the 
ground and untied him but still he did not awake however they rolled him back and forwards 
and shook and pulled him about so that after some time he came to himself stretching himself 
just as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep and looking about him he said god 
forgive you friends ye have taken me away from the sweetest and most delightful existence 
and spectacle that ever human being enjoyed or beheld now indeed do i know that all the 
pleasures of this life pass away like a shadow and a dream or fade like the flower of the 
field o illfated montesinos o sorewounded durandarte o unhappy belerma o tearful guadiana 
and ye o hapless daughters of ruidera who show in your waves the tears that flowed from 
your beauteous eyes the cousin and sancho panza listened with deep attention to the words 
of don quixote who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew them up from his very 
bowels they begged of him to explain himself and tell them what he had seen in that hell 
down there hell do you call it said don quixote call it by no such name for it does not deserve 
it as ye shall soon see he then begged them to give him something to eat as he was very hungry 
they spread the cousins sackcloth on the grass and put the stores of the alforjas into 
requisition and all three sitting down lovingly and sociably they made a luncheon and 
a supper of it all in one and when the sackcloth was removed don quixote of la mancha said 
let no one rise and attend to me my sons both of you chapter xxiii of the wonderful things 
the incomparable don quixote said he saw in the profound cave of montesinos the impossibility 
and magnitude of which cause this adventure to be deemed apocryphal it was about four 
in the afternoon when the sun veiled in clouds with subdued light and tempered beams enabled 
don quixote to relate without heat or inconvenience what he had seen in the cave of montesinos 
to his two illustrious hearers and he began as follows a matter of some twelve or fourteen 
times a mans height down in this pit on the righthand side there is a recess or space roomy 
enough to contain a large cart with its mules a little light reaches it through some chinks 
or crevices communicating with it and open to the surface of the earth this recess or space 
i perceived when i was already growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging 
suspended by the rope travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty 
or knowledge of where i was going so i resolved to enter it and rest myself for a while i called 
out telling you not to let out more rope until i bade you but you cannot have heard me i then 
gathered in the rope you were sending me and making a coil or pile of it i seated myself upon 
it ruminating and considering what i was to do to lower myself to the bottom having no one 
to hold me up and as i was thus deep in thought and perplexity suddenly and without provocation 
a profound sleep fell upon me and when i least expected it i know not how i awoke and found 
myself in the midst of the most beautiful delightful meadow that nature could produce 
or the most lively human imagination conceive i opened my eyes i rubbed them and found 
i was not asleep but thoroughly awake nevertheless i felt my head and breast to satisfy 
myself whether it was i myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom but touch feeling 
the collected thoughts that passed through my mind all convinced me that i was the same 
then and there that i am this moment next there presented itself to my sight a stately royal 
palace or castle with walls that seemed built of clear transparent crystal and through 
two great doors that opened wide therein i saw coming forth and advancing towards me a 
venerable old man clad in a long gown of mulberrycoloured serge that trailed upon the 
ground on his shoulders and breast he had a green satin collegiate hood and covering his 
head a black milanese bonnet and his snowwhite beard fell below his girdle he carried 
no arms whatever nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fairsized filberts each tenth 
bead being like a moderate ostrich egg his bearing his gait his dignity and imposing presence 
held me spellbound and wondering he approached me and the first thing he did was to make 
don quixote take off his armour and lead him in that tight chamois suit we have already 
described and depicted more than once out on a balcony overhanging one of the chief streets 
of the city in full view of the crowd and of the boys who gazed at him as they would at a monkey 
the cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him alone and not 
to enliven the festival of the day that they wore it and sancho was in high delight for it 
seemed to him that how he knew not he had fallen upon another camachos wedding another 
house like don diego de mirandas another castle like the dukes some of don antonios friends 
dined with him that day and all showed honour to don quixote and treated him as a knighterrant 
and he becoming puffed up and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction 
such were the drolleries of sancho that all the servants of the house and all who heard 
him were kept hanging upon his lips while at table don antonio said to him we hear worthy 
sancho that you are so fond of manjar blanco and forcedmeat balls that if you have any left 
you keep them in your bosom for the next day no senor thats not true said sancho for i am more 
cleanly than greedy and my master don quixote here knows well that we two are used to live 
for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts to be sure if it so happens that they offer me a heifer 
i run with a halter i mean i eat what im given and make use of opportunities as i find them 
but whoever says that im an outoftheway eater or not cleanly let me tell him that he is wrong 
and id put it in a different way if i did not respect the honourable beards that are at the 
table indeed said don quixote sanchos moderation and cleanliness in eating might be 
inscribed and graved on plates of brass to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages to come 
it is true that when he is hungry there is a certain appearance of voracity about him for 
he eats at a great pace and chews with both jaws but cleanliness he is always mindful of 
and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily so much so that he eats grapes and 
even pomegranate pips with a fork what said don antonio has sancho been a governor ay said 
sancho and of an island called barataria i governed it to perfection for ten days and lost 
my rest all the time and learned to look down upon all the governments in the world you came 
out of your mothers womb without a government you have lived until now without a government 
and when it is gods will you will go or be carried to your grave without a government how 
many there are in the world who live without a government and continue to live all the same 
and are reckoned in the number of the people the best sauce in the world is hunger and as 
the poor are never without that they always eat with a relish but mind sancho if by good 
luck you should find yourself with some government dont forget me and your children remember 
that sanchico is now full fifteen and it is right he should go to school if his uncle the 
abbot has a mind to have him trained for the church consider too that your daughter marisancha 
will not die of grief if we marry her for i have my suspicions that she is as eager to get a 
husband as you to get a government and after all a daughter looks better ill married than 
well whored by my faith replied sancho if god brings me to get any sort of a government i 
intend wife to make such a high match for marisancha that there will be no approaching 
her without calling her my lady nay sancho returned teresa marry her to her equal that 
is the safest plan for if you put her out of wooden clogs into highheeled shoes out of her 
grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns out of the plain marica and thou into 
dona soandso and my lady the girl wont know where she is and at every turn she will fall into 
a thousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun stuff tut you fool 
said sancho it will be only to practise it for two or three years and then dignity and decorum 
will fit her as easily as a glove and if not what matter let her he my lady and never mind what 
happens keep to your own station sancho replied teresa dont try to raise yourself higher 
and bear in mind the proverb that says wipe the nose of your neigbbours son and take him 
into your house a fine thing it would be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads 
every moment with everyone who called them by that nameor the cazoleros berengeneros 
ballenatos jaboneros or the bearers of all the other names and titles that are always 
in the mouth of the boys and common people it would be a nice business indeed if all these 
illustrious cities were to take huff and revenge themselves and go about perpetually 
making trombones of their swords in every petty quarrel no no god forbid there are four 
things for which sensible men and wellordered states ought to take up arms draw their 
swords and risk their persons lives and properties the first is to defend the catholic 
faith the second to defend ones life which is in accordance with natural and divine law 
the third in defence of ones honour family and property the fourth in the service of ones 
king in a just war and if to these we choose to add a fifth which may be included in the second 
in defence of ones country to these five as it were capital causes there may be added some 
others that may be just and reasonable and make it a duty to take up arms but to take them 
up for trifles and things to laugh at and he amused by rather than offended looks as though 
he who did so was altogether wanting in common sense moreover to take an unjust revenge 
and there cannot be any just one is directly opposed to the sacred law that we acknowledge 
wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to love them that hate us a command 
which though it seems somewhat difficult to obey is only so to those who have in them less 
of god than of the world and more of the flesh than of the spirit for jesus christ god and 
true man who never lied and could not and cannot lie said as our lawgiver that his yoke was 
easy and his burden light he would not therefore have laid any command upon us that it was 
impossible to obey thus sirs you are bound to keep quiet by human and divine law the devil 
take me said sancho to himself at this but this master of mine is a tologian or if not faith 
hes as like one as one egg is like another don quixote stopped to take breath and observing 
that silence was still preserved had a mind to continue his discourse and would have done 
so had not montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be useless particularly 
as the time was drawing near when it would be necessary for me to quit the cavern he told 
me moreover that in course of time he would let me know how he and belerma and durandarte 
and all who were there were to be disenchanted but of all i saw and observed down there what 
gave me most pain was that while montesinos was speaking to me one of the two companions 
of the hapless dulcinea approached me on one without my having seen her coming and with 
tears in her eyes said to me in a low agitated voice my lady dulcinea del toboso kisses your 
worships hands and entreats you to do her the favour of letting her know how you are and 
being in great need she also entreats your worship as earnestly as she can to be so good 
as to make a declaration before the alcalde of this village that you never in all your life 
saw me until now and that neither am i the don quixote in print in the second part nor this 
sancho panza my squire the one your worship knew that i will do most willingly replied 
don alvaro though it amazes me to find two don quixotes and two sancho panzas at once as 
much alike in name as they differ in demeanour and again i say and declare that what i saw 
i cannot have seen and that what happened me cannot have happened no doubt your worship 
is enchanted like my lady dulcinea del toboso said sancho and would to heaven your disenchantment 
rested on my giving myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what im giving myself 
for her for id lay them on without looking for anything i dont understand that about the 
lashes said don alvaro sancho replied that it was a long story to tell but he would tell 
him if they happened to be going the same road by this dinnertime arrived and don quixote 
and don alvaro dined together the alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together 
with a notary and don quixote laid a petition before him showing that it was requisite 
for his rights that don alvaro tarfe the gentleman there present should make a declaration 
before him that he did not know don quixote of la mancha also there present and that he was 
not the one that was in print in a history entitled second part of don quixote of la mancha 
hoc scripserunt monicongo academician of argamasilla on the tomb of dulcinea del toboso 
epitaph here dulcinea lies plump was she and robust now she is ashes and dust the end of 
all flesh that dies a lady of high degree with the port of a lofty dame and the great don quixotes 
flame and the pride of her village was she these were all the verses that could be deciphered 
the rest the writing being wormeaten were handed over to one of the academicians to make 
out their meaning conjecturally we have been informed that at the cost of many sleepless 
nights and much toil he has succeeded and that he means to publish them in hopes of don quixotes 
third sally forse altro cantera con miglior plectro end of part i don quixote volume ii 
complete by miguel de cervantes translated by john ormsby contents part ii chapter i 
of the interview the curate and the barber had with don quixote about his malady cide hamete 
benengeli in the second part of this history and third sally of don quixote says that the 
curate and the barber who had been listening to all attentively and in silence on his part 
some kindly words also and with no less goodwill than the curate offered his services 
in any way that might be of use to them he also explained to them in a few words the object 
that had brought them there and the strange nature of don quixotes madness and how they 
were waiting for his squire who had gone in search of him like the recollection of a dream 
the quarrel he had had with don quixote came back to cardenios memory and he described 
it to the others but he was unable to say what the dispute was about at this moment they heard 
a shout and recognised it as coming from sancho panza who not finding them where he had 
left them was calling aloud to them they went to meet him and in answer to their inquiries 
about don quixote he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt lank yellow half 
dead with hunger and sighing for his lady dulcinea and although he had told him that she 
commanded him to quit that place and come to el toboso where she was expecting him he had 
answered that he was determined not to confess unless quiteria first gave him her hand 
in marriage for that happiness would compose his mind and give him courage to make his 
confession don quixote hearing the wounded mans entreaty exclaimed aloud that what 
basilio asked was just and reasonable and moreover a request that might be easily complied 
with and that it would be as much to senor camachos honour to receive the lady quiteria 
as the widow of the brave basilio as if he received her direct from her father in this case 
said he it will be only to say yes and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word 
for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave camacho was listening to all this 
perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do but so urgent were the entreaties 
of basilios friends imploring him to allow quiteria to give him her hand so that his soul 
quitting this life in despair should not be lost that they moved nay forced him to say that 
if quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied as it was only putting off the fulfillment 
of his wishes for a moment at once all assailed quiteria and pressed her some with prayers 
and others with tears and others with persuasive arguments to give her hand to poor basilio 
but she harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue seemed unable or unwilling 
to utter a word nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly 
what she meant to do as basilio now had his soul at his teeth and there was no time for hesitation 
on this the fair quiteria to all appearance distressed grieved and repentant advanced 
without a word to where basilio lay his eyes already turned in his head his breathing short 
and painful murmuring the name of quiteria between his teeth and apparently about to 
die like a heathen and not like a christian quiteria approached him and kneeling demanded 
his hand by signs without speaking basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her said 
o quiteria why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve 
as a dagger to rob me of life for i have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness 
thou givest me in accepting me as thine or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing 
the dread shadow of death over my eyes what i entreat of thee o thou fatal star to me is that 
the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me be not given out of complaisance or to 
deceive me afresh but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon 
thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband for it is not meet that thou shouldst 
trifle with me at such a moment as this or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt 
so truly by thee while uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders 
expected each return of faintness would take his life with it then quiteria overcome 
with modesty and shame holding in her right hand the hand of basilio said no force would 
bend my will as freely therefore as it is possible for me to do so i give thee the hand of a 
lawful wife and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will untroubled and 
unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee yes i give it said basilio 
not agitated or distracted but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant 
me thus do i give myself to be thy husband and i give myself to be thy wife said quiteria whether 
thou livest many years or they carry thee from my arms to the grave for one so badly wounded 
observed sancho at this point this young man has a great deal to say they should make him 
leave off billing and cooing and attend to his soul for to my thinking he has it more on his 
tongue than at his teeth basilio and quiteria having thus joined hands the priest deeply 
moved and with tears in his eyes it shall not be said of me master mine he continued the bread 
eaten and the company dispersed nay i come of no ungrateful stock for all the world knows 
but particularly my own town who the panzas from whom i am descended were and what is more 
i know and have learned by many good words and deeds your worships desire to show me favour 
and if i have been bargaining more or less about my wages it was only to please my wife who 
when she sets herself to press a point no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives 
one to do what she wants but after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man 
anyhow which i cant deny i will be one in my own house too let who will take it amiss and so 
theres nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such 
a way that it was impossible for him to avoid letting out the male without incurring the 
enmity of the fiery and daring knight flung open the doors of the first cage containing 
as has been said the lion which was now seen to be of enormous size and grim and hideous mien 
the first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in which he lay and protrude his claws 
and stretch himself thoroughly he next opened his mouth and yawned very leisurely and 
with near two palms length of tongue that he had thrust forth he licked the dust out of his 
eyes and washed his face having done this he put his head out of the cage and looked all round 
with eyes like glowing coals a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity 
itself don quixote merely observed him steadily longing for him to leap from the cart 
and come to close quarters with him when he hoped to hew him in pieces so far did his unparalleled 
madness go but the noble lion more courteous than arrogant not troubling himself about 
silly bravado after having looked all round as has been said turned about and presented 
his hindquarters to don quixote and very coolly and tranquilly lay down again in the cage 
seeing this don quixote ordered the keeper to take a stick to him and provoke him to make 
him come out that i wont said the keeper for if i anger him the first hell tear in pieces will 
be myself be satisfied sir knight with what you have done which leaves nothing more to 
be said on the score of courage and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time the lion has 
the door open he is free to come out or not to come out but as he has not come out so far he will 
not come out today your worships great courage has been fully manifested already no brave 
champion so it strikes me is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for him on 
the field if his adversary does not come on him lies the disgrace and he who waits for him 
carries off the crown of victory that is true said don quixote and the reason is that he 
who is not liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone women children and ecclesiastics 
as they cannot defend themselves though they may receive offence cannot be insulted 
because between the offence and the insult there is as your excellence very well knows 
this difference the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it and does so and 
maintains it the offence may come from any quarter without carrying insult to take an 
example a man is standing unsuspectingly in the street and ten others come up armed and 
beat him he draws his sword and quits himself like a man but the number of his antagonists 
makes it impossible for him to effect his purpose before we were heard mounted with the 
utmost quickness to where hadji morato was and with him went some of our party i however 
did not dare to leave zoraida who had fallen almost fainting in my arms to be brief those 
who had gone upstairs acted so promptly that in an instant they came down carrying hadji 
morato with his hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth which prevented him from uttering 
a word warning him at the same time that to attempt to speak would cost him his life when 
his daughter caught sight of him she covered her eyes so as not to see them again as soon 
as the cart came opposite the spot the old man rose from his lofty seat and standing up said 
in a loud voice i am the sage lirgandeo and without another word the cart then passed on 
behind it came another of the same form with another aged man enthroned who stopping the 
cart said in a voice no less solemn than that of the first i am the sage alquife the great 
friend of urganda the unknown and passed on then another cart came by at the same pace but 
the occupant of the throne was not old like the others but a man stalwart and robust and 
of a forbidding countenance who as he came up said in a voice far hoarser and more devilish 
i am the enchanter archelaus the mortal enemy of amadis of gaul and of the whole countless 
troop of his descendants odious to me now are all the profane stories of knighterrantry 
now i perceive my folly and the peril into which reading them brought me now by gods mercy 
schooled into my right senses i loathe them when the three heard him speak in this way they 
had no doubt whatever that some new craze had taken possession of him and said samson what 
senor don quixote now that we have intelligence of the lady dulcinea being disenchanted 
are you taking this line now just as we are on the point of becoming shepherds to pass our 
lives singing like princes are you thinking of turning hermit hush for heavens sake be 
rational and lets have no more nonsense all that nonsense said don quixote that until 
now has been a reality to my hurt my death will with heavens help turn to my good i feel sirs 
that i am rapidly drawing near death a truce to jesting let me have a confessor to confess 
me and a notary to make my will for in extremities like this man must not trifle with his 
soul and while the curate is confessing me let some one i beg go for the notary they looked 
at one another wondering at don quixotes words but though uncertain they were inclined 
to believe him and one of the signs by which they came to the conclusion he was dying was 
this so sudden and complete return to his senses after having been mad for to the words 
already quoted he added much more so well expressed so devout and so rational as to banish 
all doubt and convince them that he was sound of mind the curate turned them all out and 
left alone with him confessed him the bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly 
afterwards with him and with sancho who having already learned from the bachelor the 
condition his master was in and finding the housekeeper and niece weeping began to blubber 
and shed tears the confession over the curate came out saying alonso quixano the good 
is indeed dying and is indeed in his right mind we may now go in to him while he makes his will 
this news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the housekeeper niece and 
sancho panza his good squire making the tears burst from their eyes and a host of sighs 
from their hearts for of a truth as has been said more than once whether as plain alonso 
quixano the good or as don quixote of la mancha whose calling it is to give aid to the needy 
of all sorts and that being so it is not necessary for you senora to make any appeal to benevolence 
or deal in preambles only to tell your woes plainly and straightforwardly for you have 
hearers that will know how if not to remedy them to sympathise with them on hearing this 
the distressed duenna made as though she would throw herself at don quixotes feet and 
actually did fall before them and said as she strove to embrace them before these feet 
and legs i cast myself o unconquered knight as before what they are the foundations and 
pillars of knighterrantry these feet i desire to kiss for upon their steps hangs and depends 
the sole remedy for my misfortune o valorous errant whose veritable achievements leave 
behind and eclipse the fabulous ones of the amadises esplandians and belianises then 
turning from don quixote to sancho panza and grasping his hands she said o thou most loyal 
squire that ever served knighterrant and if my master don quixote in consideration of 
my many faithful services is pleased to give me some island of the many his worship says 
one may stumble on in these parts i will take it as a great favour and will not fail to serve 
her in all that may lie within my power and as you are about it you may enclose a kiss of the 
hand to my master don quixote that he may see i am grateful bread and as a good secretary 
and a good biscayan you may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best and now 
take away this cloth and give me something to eat and let me go at once for i mean to return 
this evening come and do penance with me said the curate at this for senora teresa has more 
will than means to serve so worthy a guest the page refused but had to consent at last for 
his own sake and the curate took him home with him very gladly in order to have an opportunity 
of questioning him at leisure about don quixote and his doings the bachelor offered to 
write the letters in reply for teresa but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her 
affairs for she thought him somewhat given to joking and so she gave a cake and a couple 
of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman and he wrote for her two letters one for her husband 
and the other for the duchess dictated out of her own head which are not the worst inserted 
in this great history as will be seen farther on chapter xi of the strange adventure which 
the valiant don quixote had with the car or cart of the cortes of death dejected beyond 
measure did don quixote pursue his journey turning over in his mind the cruel trick the 
enchanters had played him in changing his lady dulcinea into the vile shape of the village 
lass nor could he think of any way of restoring her to her original form and these reflections 
so absorbed him that without being aware of it he let go rocinantes bridle and he perceiving 
the liberty that was granted him stopped at every step to crop the fresh grass with which 
the plain abounded sancho recalled him from his reverie melancholy senor said he was 
made not for beasts but for men but if men give way to it overmuch they turn to beasts control 
yourself your worship be yourself again gather up rocinantes reins cheer up rouse yourself 
and show that gallant spirit that knightserrant ought to have what the devil is this what 
weakness is this are we here or in france the devil fly away with all the dulcineas in the 
world for the wellbeing of a single knighterrant is of more consequence than all the enchantments 
and transformations on earth hush sancho said don quixote in a weak and faint voice hush 
and utter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady for i alone am to blame for her misfortune 
and hard fate her calamity has come of the hatred the wicked bear me so say i returned sancho 
his heart rend in twain i trow who saw her once to see her now thou mayest well say that sancho 
replied don quixote as thou sawest her in the full perfection of her beauty for the enchantment 
does not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from thee against me alone 
and against my eyes is the strength of its venom directed nevertheless there is one thing 
which has occurred to me and that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me for as 
well as i recollect thou saidst that her eyes were pearls but eyes that are like pearls 
are rather the eyes of a seabream than of a lady and i am persuaded that dulcineas must be 
green emeralds full and soft with two rainbows for eyebrows take away those pearls from 
her eyes and transfer them to her teeth for beyond a doubt sancho thou hast taken the one 
for the other the eyes for the teeth very likely said sancho for her beauty bewildered 
me as much as her ugliness did your worship but let us leave it all to god who alone knows 
what is to happen in this vale of tears in this evil world of ours where there is hardly a 
thing to be found without some mixture of wickedness roguery and rascality but one thing 
senor troubles me more than all the rest and that is thinking what is to be done when your 
worship conquers some giant or some other knight and orders him to go and present himself 
before the beauty of the lady dulcinea where is this poor giant or this poor wretch of a 
vanquished knight to find her i think i can see them now plainer than ever great was the 
enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the irritation the worthy churchman showed 
at the longwinded halting way sancho had of telling his story while don quixote was chafing 
with rage and vexation so as i was saying continued sancho as the pair of them were going 
to sit down to table as i said the labourer insisted upon the gentlemans taking the head 
of the table and though he refused the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had 
to accept it the ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him and the duke and duchess those 
at the sides all this time sancho stood by gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown 
to his master by these illustrious persons and observing all the ceremonious pressing 
that had passed between the duke and don quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head 
of the table for there was only that seat placed and no more than one cover laid a personage 
who it appeared afterwards was a physician placed himself standing by his side with a 
whalebone wand in his hand they then lifted up a fine white cloth covering fruit and a great 
variety of dishes of different sorts one who looked like a student said grace and a page 
put a laced bib on sancho while another who played the part of head carver placed a dish 
of fruit before him but hardly had he tasted a morsel when the man with the wand touched 
the plate with it and they took it away from before him with the utmost celerity the carver 
however brought him another dish and sancho proceeded to try it but before he could get 
at it not to say taste it already the wand had touched it and a page had carried it off with 
the same promptitude as the fruit sancho seeing this was puzzled and looking from one 
to another asked if this dinner was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglery trick to 
this he with the wand replied it is not to be eaten senor governor except as is usual and 
customary in other islands where there are governors i senor am a physician and i am paid 
a salary in this island to serve its governors as such and i have a much greater regard for 
their health than for my own studying day and night and making myself acquainted with 
the governors constitution in order to be able to cure him when he falls sick the chief 
thing i have to do is to attend at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears 
to me to be fit for him and keep from him what i think will do him harm and be injurious to his 
stomach and therefore i ordered that plate of fruit to be removed as being too moist and 
that other dish i ordered to be removed as being too moist and that other dish i ordered 
to be removed as being too moist and that other dish i ordered to be removed as being too 
hot and containing many spices that stimulate thirst for he who drinks much kills and 
consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists well then said sancho that dish 
of roast partridges there that seems so savoury will not do me any harm to this the physician 
replied of those my lord the governor shall not eat so long as i live why so said sancho because 
replied the doctor our master hippocrates the polestar and beacon of medicine says in 
one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala perdicis autem pessima which means all repletion 
is bad but that of partridge is the worst of all in that case said sancho let senor doctor 
see among the dishes that are on the table what will do me most good and least harm and let 
me eat it without tapping it with his stick for by the life of the governor and so may god 
suffer me to enjoy it but im dying of hunger and in spite of the doctor and all he may say to 
deny me food is the way to take my life instead of prolonging it your worship is right senor 
governor said the physician and therefore your worship i consider should not eat of those 
stewed rabbits there because it is a furry kind of food if that veal were not roasted and 
served with pickles you might try it but it is out of the question that big dish that is smoking 
farther off said sancho seems to me to be an olla podrida and out of the diversity of things 
in such ollas i cant fail to light upon something tasty and good for me absit said the doctor 
far from us be any such base thought there is nothing in the world less nourishing than 
an olla podrida to canons or rectors of colleges or peasants weddings with your ollas 
podridas but let us have none of them on the tables of governors where everything that 
is present should be delicate and refined and the reason is that always everywhere and 
by everybody simple medicines are more esteemed than compound ones for we cannot go wrong 
in those that are simple while in the compound we may by merely altering the quantity of 
the things composing them but what i am of opinion the governor should cat now in order 
to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few thin slices 
of conserve of quinces which will settle his stomach and help his digestion sancho on 
hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the doctor steadily and in a 
solemn tone asked him what his name was and whether he knew from what part of the country 
he came the servant replied that he was called the licentiate juan perez de viedma and 
that he had heard it said he came from a village in the mountains of leon and nature had been 
kinder and more generous to it than fortune though in the general poverty of those communities 
my father passed for being even a rich man and he would have been so in reality had he been 
as clever in preserving his property as he was in spending it this tendency of his to be 
liberal and profuse he had acquired from having been a soldier in his youth for the soldiers 
life is a school in which the niggard becomes freehanded and the freehanded prodigal 
and if any soldiers are to be found who are misers they are monsters of rare occurrence 
my father went beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality a disposition by no means 
advantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his name and position my father 
had three all sons and all of sufficient age to make choice of a profession finding then 
that he was unable to resist his propensity he resolved to divest himself of the instrument 
and cause of his prodigality and lavishness to divest himself of wealth without which 
alexander himself would have seemed parsimonious and so calling us all three aside one 
day into a room he addressed us in words somewhat to the following effect my sons to assure 
you that i love you no more need be known or said than that you are my sons and to encourage 
a suspicion that i do not love you no more is needed than the knowledge that i have no selfcontrol 
as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned therefore that you may for the future 
feel sure that i love you like a father and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather i propose 
to do with you what i have for some time back meditated and after mature deliberation decided 
upon you are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least make choice of a calling 
that will bring you honour and profit when you are older and what i have resolved to do is 
to divide my property into four parts three i will give to you to each his portion without 
making any difference and the other i will retain to live upon and support myself for whatever 
remainder of life heaven may be pleased to grant me but i wish each of you on taking possession 
of the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths i shall indicate in this spain of 
ours there is a proverb to my mind very trueas they all are being short aphorisms drawn 
from long practical experienceand the one i refer to says the church or the sea or the kings 
house as much as to say in plainer language whoever wants to flourish and become rich let 
him follow the church or go to complete his studies at salamanca as soon as we had come to 
an understanding and made choice of our professions my father embraced us all and in the 
short time he mentioned carried into effect all he had promised and when he had given to 
each his share which as well as i remember was three thousand ducats apiece in cash for 
an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it down not to let it go out of the family we 
all three on the same day took leave of our good father and at the same time as it seemed to 
me inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his old age i induced him to take 
two of my three thousand ducats as the remainder would be enough to provide me with all 
a soldier needed my two brothers moved by my example gave him each a thousand ducats so 
that there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money besides three thousand 
the value of the portion that fell to him in trade the youngest and in my opinion the wisest 
said he would rather follow the church or go to complete his studies at salamanca as soon 
as we had come to an understanding and made choice of our professions my father embraced

so that there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money besides three thousand 
the value of the portion that fell to him which he preferred to retain in land instead of 
selling it finally as i said we took leave of him and of our uncle whom i have mentioned not 
without sorrow and tears on both sides they charging us to let them know whenever an opportunity 
offered how we fared whether well or ill we promised to do so and when he had embraced us 
and given us his blessing one set out for salamanca the other for seville and i for alicante 
where i had heard there was a genoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for genoa it is now 
some twentytwo years since i left my fathers house and all that time though i have written 
several letters i have had no news whatever of him or of my brothers my own adventures during 
that period i will now relate briefly i embarked at alicante reached genoa after a prosperous 
voyage and proceeded thence to milan where i provided myself with arms and a few soldiers 
accoutrements thence it was my intention to go and take service in piedmont but as i was 
already on the road to alessandria della paglia i learned that the great duke of alva was 
on his way to flanders i changed my plans joined him served under him in the campaigns he 
made was present at the deaths of the counts egmont and horn and was promoted to be ensign 
under a famous captain of guadalajara diego de urbina by name some time after my arrival 
in flanders news came of the league that his holiness pope pius v of happy memory had made 
with venice and spain against the common enemy the turk who had just then with his fleet 
taken the famous island of cyprus which belonged to the venetians a loss deplorable and 
disastrous it was known as a fact that the most serene don john of austria natural brother 
of our good king don philip was coming as commanderinchief of the allied forces and rumours 
were abroad of the vast warlike preparations which were being made all which stirred 
my heart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which was expected and 
though i had reason to believe and almost certain promises that on the first opportunity 
that presented itself feeling sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed 
upon him in the course of the altercation among other things the barber said gentlemen 
this packsaddle is mine as surely as i owe god a death and i know it as well as if i had given 
birth to it and here is my ass in the stable who will not let me lie only try it and if it does 
not fit him like a glove call me a rascal and what is more the same day i was robbed of this 
they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin never yet handselled that would fetch a crown 
any day at this don quixote could not keep himself from answering and interposing between 
the two and separating them he placed the packsaddle on the ground to lie there in sight 
until the truth was established and said your worships may perceive clearly and plainly 
the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was is and shall 
be the helmet of mambrino which i won from him in air war and made myself master of by legitimate 
and lawful possession with the packsaddle i do not concern myself but i may tell you on 
that head that my squire sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this 
vanquished poltroons steed and with it adorn his own i allowed him and he took it and as 
to its having been changed from a caparison into a packsaddle i can give no explanation 
except the usual one that such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry 
to confirm all which run sancho my son and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow 
calls a basin egad master said sancho if we have no other proof of our case than what your 
worship puts forward mambrinos helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellows caparison 
is a packsaddle do as i bid thee said don quixote it cannot be that everything in this castle 
goes by enchantment sancho hastened to where the basin was and brought it back with him 
and when don quixote saw it he took hold of it and said your worships may see with what a face 
this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the helmet i told you of and i swear by 
the order of chivalry i profess that this helmet is the identical one i took from him without 
anything added to or taken from it there is no doubt of that observed anselmo anxious to 
support and uphold lotharios ideas with camilla who was as regardless of his design as 
she was deep in love with lothario and so taking delight in anything that was his and knowing 
that his thoughts and writings had her for their object and that she herself was the real 
chloris she asked him to repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any i do replied 
lothario but i do not think it as good as the first one or more correctly speaking less bad 
but you can easily judge for it is this sonnet i know that i am doomed death is to me as certain 
as that thou ungrateful fair dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying ere my heart repented 
of its love for thee if buried in oblivion i should be bereft of life fame favour even there 
it would be found that i thy image bear deep graven in my breast for all to see this like some 
holy relic do i prize to save me from the fate my truth entails truth that to thy hard heart 
its vigour owes alas for him that under lowering skies in peril oer a trackless ocean sails 
where neither friendly port nor polestar shows anselmo praised this second sonnet too 
as he had praised the first and so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which 
he was binding himself and making his dishonour secure for when lothario was doing most 
to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured and thus each step that camilla descended 
towards the depths of her abasement she mounted in his opinion towards the summit of virtue 
and fair fame it so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid camilla 
said to her i am ashamed to think my dear leonela how lightly i have valued myself that i 
did not compel lothario to purchase by at least some expenditure of time that full possession 
of me that i so quickly yielded him of my own free will i having as little fancy for it as for 
turning cacique well then the fact is friend sancho said the duke that unless you become 
softer than a ripe fig you shall not get hold of the government it would be a nice thing if 
after people had been at the trouble of coming to look for him on business the governor 
were to be away in the forest enjoying himself the government would go on badly in that 
fashion by my faith senor hunting and amusements are more fit for idlers than for governors 
what i intend to amuse myself with is playing all fours at eastertime and bowls on sundays 
and holidays for these huntings dont suit my condition or agree with my conscience god 
grant it may turn out so said the duke because its a long step from saying to doing and i hold 
to the renegade for he seems to me an honest goodhearted fellow don antonio then said that 
if the renegade did not prove successful the expedient of the great don quixotes expedition 
to barbary should be adopted two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light vessel 
of six oars aside manned by a stout crew and two days later the galleys made sail eastward 
the general having begged the viceroy to let him know all about the release of don gregorio 
and about ana felix and the viceroy promised to do as he requested one morning as don quixote 
went out for a stroll along the beach arrayed in full armour for as he often said that was 
his only gear his only rest the fray and he never was without it for a moment he saw coming 
towards him a knight also in full armour with a shining moon painted on his shield who on 
approaching sufficiently near to be heard said in a loud voice addressing himself to 
don quixote illustrious knight and never sufficiently extolled don quixote of la mancha 
i am the knight of the white moon replied that it was a question of precedence of beauty 
and briefly told him what he had said to don quixote and how the conditions of the defiance 
agreed upon on both sides had been accepted the viceroy went over to don antonio and asked 
in a low voice did he know who the knight of the white moon had been seen from the city and 
it was told the viceroy how he was in conversation with don quixote the viceroy fancying 
it must be some fresh adventure got up by don antonio moreno or some other gentleman of 
the city hurried out at once to the beach accompanied by don antonio and several other 
gentlemen just as don quixote was wheeling rocinante round in order to take up the necessary 
distance the viceroy upon this seeing that the pair of them were evidently preparing 
to come to the charge put himself between them asking them what it was that led them to engage 
in combat all of a sudden in this way the knight of the white moon was who had left don quixote 
in such a sad plight chapter lxv wherein is made known who the knight of the mirrors and 
his squire were don quixote went off satisfied elated and vainglorious in the highest 
degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he fancied him of the mirrors 
to be and one from whose knightly word he expected to learn whether the enchantment of 
his lady still continued inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound under the penalty 
of ceasing to be one to return and render him an account of what took place between him and 
her but don quixote was of one mind he of the mirrors of another for he just then had no thought 
of anything but finding some village where he could plaster himself as has been said already 
the history goes on to say then that when the bachelor samson carrasco recommended don 
quixote to resume his knighterrantry which he had laid aside it was in consequence of 
having been previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to be adopted 
to induce don quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet without worrying himself with 
his illstarred adventures at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote 
of all and on the special advice of carrasco that don quixote should be allowed to go as 
it seemed impossible to restrain him and that samson should sally forth to meet him as 
a knighterrant and do battle with him for there would be no difficulty about a cause and 
vanquish him that being looked upon as an easy matter and that it should be agreed and settled 
that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor then don quixote being vanquished 
the bachelor knight was to command him to return to his village and his house and not quit 
it for two years or until he received further orders from him all which it was clear don 
quixote would unhesitatingly obey rather than contravene or fail to observe the laws 
of chivalry and during the period of his seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly or 
there might be an opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness carrasco 
undertook the task and tom cecial a gossip and neighbour of sancho panzas a lively featherheaded 
fellow offered himself as his squire carrasco armed himself in the fashion described 
and tom cecial that he might not be known by his gossip when they met fitted on over his own 
natural nose the false masquerade one that has been mentioned and so they followed the 
same route don quixote took and almost came up with him in time to be present at the adventure 
of the cart of death and finally encountered them in the grove where all that the sagacious 
reader has been reading about took place and had it not been for the extraordinary fancies 
of don quixote and his conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor senor bachelor 
would have been incapacitated for ever from taking his degree of licentiate all through 
not finding nests where he thought to find birds tom cecial seeing how ill they had succeeded 
and what a sorry end their expedition had come to said to the bachelor sure enough senor 
samson carrasco we are served right it is easy enough to plan and set about an enterprise 
but it is often a difficult matter to come well out of it don quixote a madman and we sane 
he goes off laughing safe and sound and you are left sore and sorry id like to know now which 
is the madder he who is so because he cannot help it or he who is so of his own choice to which 
samson replied the difference between the two sorts of madmen is that he who is so will 
he nil he will be one always while he who is so of his own choice to which samson replied the 
difference between the two sorts of madmen is that he who is so will he nil he will be one 
always while he who is so of his own choice to which samson replied the difference between 
the two sorts of madmen is that he who is so will he nil he will be one always while he who is 
so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes in that case said tom cecial 
i was a madman of my own accord when i volunteered to become your squire and of my own accord 
ill leave off being one and go home thats your affair returned samson but to suppose that 
i am going to travel on foot and make long ones is to suppose nonsense thou sayest well sancho 
said don quixote let my armour be hung up for a trophy and under it or round it we will carve 
on the trees what was inscribed on the trophy of rolands armour these let none move who 
dareth not his might with roland prove although mine is of the cachopins of laredo said 
the traveller i will not venture to compare it with that of el toboso of la mancha though 
to tell the truth no such surname has until now ever reached my ears what said don quixote 
has that never reached them the rest of the party went along listening with great attention 
to the conversation of the pair and even the very goatherds and shepherds perceived how 
exceedingly out of his wits our don quixote was sancho panza alone thought that what his 
master said was the truth knowing who he was and having known him from his birth and all 
that he felt any difficulty in believing was that about the fair dulcinea del toboso because 
neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his knowledge though he lived 
so close to el toboso they were going along conversing in this way when they saw descending 
a gap between two high mountains some twenty shepherds all clad in sheepskins of black 
wool and crowned with garlands which as afterwards appeared were some of them of yew some 
of cypress six of the number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowers 
and branches on seeing which one of the goatherds said that your worship senor knighterrant 
may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready goodwill we will give you 
amusement and pleasure by making one of our comrades sing he will be here before long and 
he is a very intelligent youth and deep in love and what is more he can read and write and 
play on the rebeck to perfection the goatherd had hardly done speaking when the notes 
of the rebeck reached their ears and shortly after the player came up a very goodlooking 
young man of about twoandtwenty his comrades asked him if he had supped and on his replying 
that he had he who had already made the offer said to him in that case antonio thou mayest 
as well do us the pleasure of singing a little that the gentleman our guest may see that 
even in the mountains and woods there are musicians we have told him of thy accomplishments 
and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true so as thou livest pray sit down and 
sing that ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee and that was so 
much liked in the town with all my heart said the gentleman that on the goletta runs thus 
chapter xl in which the story of the captive is continued sonnet blest souls that from 
this mortal husk set free in guerdon of brave deeds beatified above this lowly orb of ours 
abide made heirs of heaven and immortality with noble rage and ardour glowing ye your 
strength while strength was yours in battle plied and with your own blood and the foemans 
dyed the sandy soil and the encircling sea it was the ebbing lifeblood first that failed 
the weary arms the stout hearts never quailed though vanquished yet ye earned the victors 
crown though mourned yet still triumphant was your fall for there ye won between the sword 
and wall in heaven glory and on earth renown that is it exactly according to my recollection 
said the captive well then that on the fort said the gentleman if my memory serves me goes 
thus sonnet up from this wasted soil this shattered shell whose walls and towers here 
in ruin lie three thousand soldier souls took wing on high in the bright mansions of the 
blest to dwell the onslaught of the foeman to repel by might of arm all vainly did they try 
and when at length twas left them but to die wearied and few the last defenders fell and 
this same arid soil hath ever been a haunt of countless mournful memories as well in our 
day as in days of yore but never yet to heaven it sent i ween from its hard bosom purer souls 
than these or braver bodies on its surface bore the sonnets were not disliked and the captive 
was rejoiced at the tidings they gave him of his comrade and continuing his tale he went 
on to say the goletta and the fort being thus in their hands the turks gave orders to dismantle 
the golettafor the fort was reduced to such a state that there was nothing left to leveland 
to do the work more quickly and easily they mined it in three places but nowhere were they 
able to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong that is to say the old walls while 
all that remained standing of the new fortifications that the fratin had made came to 
the ground with the greatest ease finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant 
to constantinople and a few months later died my master el uchali otherwise uchali fartax 
which means in turkish the scabby renegade for that he was it is the practice with the turks 
to name people from some defect or virtue they may possess the reason being that there 
are among them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their descent from the 
ottoman house and the others as i have said take their names and surnames either from bodily 
blemishes or moral qualities this scabby one rowed at the oar as a slave of the grand signors 
for fourteen years and when over thirtyfour years of age in resentment at having been 
struck by a turk while at the oar turned renegade and renounced his faith in order to be 
able to cure him when he falls sick the chief thing i have to do is to attend at his dinners 
and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to be fit for him and keep from him what 
i think will do him harm and be injurious to his stomach and therefore i ordered that plate 
of fruit to be removed as being too moist and that other dish i ordered to be removed as being 
too hot and containing many spices that stimulate thirst for he who drinks much kills 
and consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists well then said sancho that dish 
of roast partridges there that seems so savoury will not do me any harm to this the physician 
replied of those my lord the governor shall not eat so long as i live why so said sancho because 
replied the doctor our master hippocrates the polestar and beacon of medicine says in 
one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala perdicis autem pessima which means all repletion 
is bad but that of partridge is the worst of all in that case said sancho let senor doctor 
see among the dishes that are on the table what will do me most good and least harm and let 
me eat it without tapping it with his stick for by the life of the governor and so may god 
suffer me to enjoy it but im dying of hunger and in spite of the doctor and all he may say to 
deny me food is the way to take my life instead of prolonging it your worship is right senor 
governor said the physician and therefore your worship i consider should not eat of those 
stewed rabbits there because it is a furry kind of food if that veal were not roasted and 
served with pickles you might try it but it is out of the question that big dish that is smoking 
farther off said sancho seems to me to be an olla podrida and out of the diversity of things 
in such ollas i cant fail to light upon something tasty and good for me absit said the doctor 
far from us be any such base thought there is nothing in the world less nourishing than 
an olla podrida to canons or rectors of colleges or peasants weddings with your ollas 
podridas but let us have none of them on the tables of governors where everything that 
is present should be delicate and refined and the reason is that always everywhere and 
by everybody simple medicines are more esteemed than compound ones for we cannot go wrong 
in those that are simple while in the compound we may by merely altering the quantity of 
the things composing them but what i am of opinion the governor should cat now in order 
to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few thin slices 
of conserve of quinces which will settle his stomach and help his digestion sancho on 
hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the doctor steadily and in a 
solemn tone asked him what his name was and whether he knew from what part of the country 
he came the servant replied that he was called the licentiate juan perez de viedma and 
that he had heard it said he came from a village in the mountains of leon and he mentioned 
a circumstance connected with his father and his brothers which had it not been told me 
by so truthful a man as he was i should have set down as one of those fables the old women tell 
over the fire in winter for he said his father had divided his property among his three 
sons and had addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of catos but i can say this 
much that the choice he made of going to the wars was attended with such success that by 
his gallant conduct and courage and without any help save his own merit he rose in a few 
years to be captain of infantry and to see himself on the highroad and in position to be 
given the command of a corps before long but fortune was against him for where he might 
have expected her favour he lost it and with it his liberty on that glorious day when so 
many recovered theirs at the battle of lepanto i lost mine at the goletta and after a variety 
of adventures we found ourselves comrades at constantinople thence he went to algiers 
where he met with one of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in 
the world here the curate went on to relate briefly his brothers adventure with zoraida 
to all which the judge gave such an attentive hearing that he never before had been so much 
of a hearer the curate however only went so far as to describe how the frenchmen plundered 
those who were in the boat and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the fair 
moor were left of whom he said he had not been able to learn what became of them or whether 
they had reached spain or been carried to france by the frenchmen the captain standing 
a little to one side was listening to all the curate said and watching every movement of 
his brother who as soon as he perceived the curate had made an end of his story gave a deep 
sigh and said with his eyes full of tears oh senor if you only knew what news you have given 
me and how it comes home to me making me show how i feel it with these tears that spring from 
my eyes in spite of all my worldly wisdom and selfrestraint that brave captain that you 
speak of is my eldest brother who being of a bolder and loftier mind than my other brother 
or myself chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms which was one of the three careers 
our father proposed to us as your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling 
you i followed that of letters in which god and my own exertions have raised me to the position 
in which you see me my second brother is in peru so wealthy that with what he has sent to my 
father and to me he has fully repaid the portion he took with him and has even furnished 
my fathers hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity while i too have 
been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming and creditable fashion and so to attain 
my present standing my father is still alive though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest 
son and he prays god unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he has looked upon 
those of his son but with regard to him what surprises me is that having so much common sense 
as he had he should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself either in his 
troubles and sufferings or in his prosperity for if his father or any of us had known of 
his condition he need not have waited for that miracle of the reed to obtain his ransom 
but what now disquiets me is the uncertainty whether those frenchmen may have restored 
him to liberty or murdered him to hide the robbery all this will make me continue my journey 
not with the satisfaction in which i began it but in the deepest melancholy and sadness 
oh dear brother that i only knew where thou art now and i would hasten to seek thee out and 
deliver thee from thy sufferings though it were to cost me suffering myself oh that i could 
bring news to our old father that thou art alive even wert thou the deepest dungeon of barbary 
for his wealth and my brothers and mine would rescue thee thence oh beautiful and generous 
zoraida that i could repay thy good goodness to a brother that i could be present at the 
new birth of thy soul and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness all this and 
more the judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news he had received of his brother 
that all who heard him shared in it showing their sympathy with his sorrow the curate seeing 
then how well he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captains wishes had 
no desire to keep them unhappy any longer so he rose from the table and going into the room 
where zoraida was he took her by the hand luscinda dorothea and the judges daughter following 
her the captain was waiting to see what the curate would do when the latter taking him with 
the other hand advanced with both of them to where the judge and the other gentlemen were 
and said let your tears cease to flow senor judge and the wish of your heart be gratified 
as fully as you could desire for you have before you your worthy brother and your good sisterinlaw 
he whom you see here is the captain viedma and this is the fair moor who has been so good to 
him the frenchmen i told you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you 
may show the generosity of your kind heart the captain ran to embrace his brother who placed 
both hands on his breast so as to have a good look at him holding him a little way off but as 
soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so closely shedding such 
tears of heartfelt joy that most of those present could not but join in them the words the 
brothers exchanged the emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined i fancy much less 
put down in writing they told each other in a few words the events of their lives they showed 
the true affection of brothers in all its strength then the judge embraced zoraida putting 
all he possessed at her disposal then he made his daughter embrace her and the fair christian 
and the lovely moor drew fresh tears from every eye and there was don quixote observing 
all these strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word and attributing 
the whole to chimeras of knighterrantry then they agreed that the captain and zoraida 
should return with his brother to seville and send news to his father of his having been 
delivered and found so as to enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism 
of zoraida for it was impossible for the judge to put off his journey as he was informed 
that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from seville for new spain and to miss 
the passage would have been a great inconvenience to him in short everybody was well pleased 
and glad at the captives good fortune and as now almost twothirds of the night were past 
they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it don quixote offered to mount guard 
over the castle lest they should be attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel 
covetous of the great treasure of beauty the castle contained those who understood him 
returned him thanks for this service and they gave the judge an account of his extraordinary 
humour with which he was not a little amused sancho panza alone was fuming at the lateness 
of the hour for retiring to rest and he of all was the one that made himself most comfortable 
as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass which as will be told farther on cost 
him so dear the ladies then having retired to their chamber and the others having disposed 
themselves with as little discomfort as they could don quixote sallied out of the inn 
to act as sentinel of the castle as he had promised it happened however that a little before 
the approach of dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it 
forced them all to listen attentively but especially dorothea who had been awake and 
by whose side dona clara de viedma for so the judges daughter was called lay sleeping no 
one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly and the voice was unaccompanied by any 
instrument at one moment it seemed to him that he could have laid hold of it with his hand 
and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he should be seized with giddiness so that 
sancho it will not do for us to uncover ourselves for he who has us in charge will be responsible 
for us and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us to descend at 
one swoop on the kingdom of kandy as the saker or falcon does on the heron so as to seize it 
however high it may soar and though it seems to us not half an hour since we left the garden 
believe me we must have travelled a great distance i dont know how that may be said sancho 
all i know is that if the senora magallanes or magalona was satisfied with this croup she 
could not have been very tender of flesh the duke the duchess and all in the garden were 
listening to the conversation of the two heroes and were beyond measure amused by it and 
now desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and wellcontrived adventure they 
applied a light to clavilenos tail with some tow and the horse being full of squibs and 
crackers immediately blew up with a prodigious noise and brought don quixote and sancho 
panza to the ground half singed by this time the bearded band of duennas the trifaldi and 
all had vanished from the garden and those that remained lay stretched on the ground as 
if in a faint leonela and lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe and seeing 
camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they were still uncertain as to 
the true nature of the act lothario terrified and breathless ran in haste to pluck out 
the dagger but when he saw how slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and once 
more admired the subtlety coolness and ready wit of the fair camilla and the better to 
support the part he had to play he began to utter profuse and doleful lamentations over 
her body as if she were dead invoking maledictions not only on himself but also on him who 
had been the means of placing him in such a position and knowing that his friend anselmo 
heard him he spoke in such a way that he cast suspicion on the governor and made his relations 
appear covetous and heartless and himself so rational that the chaplain determined 
to take him away with him that the archbishop might see him and ascertain for himself the 
truth of the matter yielding to this conviction the worthy chaplain begged the governor 
to have the clothes in which the licentiate had entered the house given to him the governor 
again bade him beware of what he was doing as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad 
but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking 
him away the governor seeing that it was the order of the archbishop obeyed and they dressed 
the licentiate in his own clothes which were new and decent he as soon as he saw it flung 
himself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders and squeezed its throat with both 
hands with such force that the serpent finding he was throttling it had nothing for it 
but to let itself sink to the bottom of the river carrying with it the knight who would not 
let go his hold and when they got down there he found himself among palaces and gardens 
so pretty that it was a wonder to see and then the serpent changed itself into an old ancient 
man who told him such things as were never heard hold your peace senor for if you were to 
hear this you would go mad with delight a couple of figs for your great captain and your 
diego garcia hearing this dorothea said in a whisper to cardenio our landlord is almost 
fit to play a second part to don quixote i think so said cardenio for as he shows he accepts 
it as a certainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it is written 
down and the barefooted friars themselves would not persuade him to the contrary but 
consider brother said the curate once more there never was any felixmarte of hircania 
in the world nor any cirongilio of thrace or any of the other knights of the same sort that 
the books of chivalry talk of the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of idle 
wits devised by them for the purpose you describe of beguiling the time as your reapers 
do when they read for i swear to you in all seriousness there never were any such knights 
in the world and no such exploits or nonsense ever happened anywhere try that bone on another 
dog said the landlord as if i did not know how many make five and where my shoe pinches me 
dont think to feed me with pap for by god i am no fool it is a good joke for your worship to try 
and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and lies and they printed 
by the license of the lords of the royal council as if they were people who would allow such 
a lot of lies to be printed all together and so many battles and enchantments that they 
take away ones senses i have told you friend said the curate that this is done to divert 
our idle thoughts and as in wellordered states games of chess fives and billiards are 
allowed for the diversion of those who do not care or are not obliged or are unable to work 
so books of this kind are allowed to be printed on the supposition that what indeed is the 
truth there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories and if it were 
permitted me now and the present company desired it i could say something about the qualities 
books of chivalry should possess to be good ones that would be to the advantage and even 
to the taste of some but i hope the time will come when i can communicate my ideas to some 
one who may be able to mend matters and in the meantime senor landlord believe what i have 
said and take your books and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood and much good 
may they do you i dont see one said sancho wait a bit said the cook sinner that i am how particular 
and bashful you are and so saying he seized a bucket and plunging it into one of the half 
jars took up three hens and a couple of geese and said to sancho fall to friend and take the 
edge off your appetite with these skimmings until dinnertime comes i have nothing to 
put them in said sancho well then said the cook take spoon and all for camachos wealth and 
happiness furnish everything while sancho fared thus don quixote was watching the entrance 
at one end of the arcade of some twelve peasants all in holiday and gala dress mounted on 
twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field trappings and a number of little bells 
attached to their petrals who marshalled in regular order ran not one but several courses 
over the meadow with jubilant shouts and cries of long live camacho and quiteria he as 
rich as she is fair and she the fairest on earth hearing this don quixote said to himself 
it is easy to see these folk have never seen my dulcinea del toboso for if they had they would 
be more moderate in their praises of this quiteria of theirs shortly after this several 
bands of dancers of various sorts began to enter the arcade at different points and among 
them one of sworddancers composed of some fourandtwenty lads of gallant and highspirited 
mien clad in the finest and whitest of linen and with handkerchiefs embroidered in various 
colours with fine silk and one of those on the mares asked an active youth who led them if 
any of the dancers had been wounded as yet thank god no one has been wounded said he we are 
all safe and sound and he at once began to execute complicated figures with the rest of 
his comrades with so many turns and so great dexterity that although don quixote was well 
used to see dances of the same kind he thought he had never seen any so good as this he also 
admired another that came in composed of fair young maidens none of whom seemed to be under 
fourteen or over eighteen years of age all clad in green stuff with their locks partly 
braided partly flowing loose but all of such bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams and 
over them they wore garlands of jessamine roses amaranth and honeysuckle at their head 
were a venerable old man and an ancient dame more brisk and active however than might have 
been expected from their years the notes of a zamora bagpipe accompanied them and with 
modesty in their countenances and in their eyes and lightness in their feet they looked 
the best dancers in the world following these there came an artistic dance of the sort 
they call speaking dances it was composed of eight nymphs in two files with the god cupid 
leading one and interest the other the former furnished with wings bow quiver and arrows 
the latter in a rich dress of gold and silk of divers colours the nymphs that followed love 
bore their names written on white parchment in large letters on their backs poetry was 
the name of the first wit of the second birth of the third and valour of the fourth those 
that followed interest were distinguished in the same way the badge of the first announced 
liberality that of the second largess the third treasure and the fourth peaceful possession 
in front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by four wild men all clad in ivy and hemp stained 
green and looking so natural that they nearly terrified sancho on the front of the castle 
and on each of the four sides of its frame it bore the inscription castle of caution four 
skillful tabor and flute players accompanied them and the dance having been opened cupid 
after executing two figures raised his eyes and bent his bow against a damsel who stood 
between the turrets of the castle and thus addressed her i am the mighty god whose sway 
is potent over land and sea the heavens above us own me nay the shades below acknowledge 
me i know not fear i have my will whateer my whim or fancy be for me theres no impossible i 
order bind forbid set free having concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top 
of the castle and went back to his place interest then came forward and went through two 
more figures and as soon as the tabors ceased he said but mightier than love am i though 
love it be that leads me on than mine no lineage is more high or older underneath the sun 
to use me rightly few know how to act without me fewer still for i am interest and i vow for 
evermore to do thy will interest retired and poetry came forward and when she had gone 
through her figures like the others fixing her eyes on the damsel of the castle she said 
with many a fanciful conceit fair lady winsome poesy her soul an offering at thy feet presents 
in sonnets unto thee if thou my homage wilt not scorn thy fortune watched by envious eyes 
on wings of poesy upborne shall be exalted to the skies poetry withdrew and on the side 
of interest liberality advanced and after having gone through her figures said to give 
while shunning each extreme the sparing hand the overfree therein consists so wise men 
deem the virtue liberality but thee fair lady to enrich myself a prodigal ill prove a vice 
not wholly shameful which may find its fair excuse in love in the same manner all the characters 
of the two bands advanced and retired and each executed its figures and delivered its 
verses some of them graceful some burlesque but don quixotes memory though he had an excellent 
one only carried away those that have been just quoted all then mingled together forming 
chains and breaking off again with graceful unconstrained gaiety and whenever love 
passed in front of the castle he shot his arrows up at it while interest broke gilded pellets 
against it at length after they had danced a good while interest drew out a great purse 
made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to all appearance full of money and flung it 
at the castle and with the force of the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down leaving 
the damsel exposed and unprotected interest and the characters of his band advanced 
and throwing a great chain of gold over her neck pretended to take her and lead her away 
captive on seeing which love and his supporters made as though they would release her 
the whole action being to the accompaniment of the tabors and in the form of a regular dance 
the wild men made peace between them and with great dexterity readjusted and fixed the 
boards of the castle and the damsel once more ensconced herself within and with this the 
dance wound up to the great enjoyment of the beholders don quixote asked one of the nymphs 
who it was that had composed and arranged it she replied that it was a beneficiary of the 
town who had a nice taste in devising things of the sort i will lay a wager said don quixote 
that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend of camachos than of basilios 
and that he is better at satire than at vespers he has introduced the accomplishments 
of basilio and the riches of camacho very neatly into the dance sancho panza who was listening 
to all this said i give itmoreover one who is enchanted as i am cannot do as he likes with 
himself for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three 
ages and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flyingand that being so they might 
as well release him particularly as it would be to the advantage of all for if they did not 
let him out he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they 
kept their distance the canon took his hand tied together as they both were and on his word 
and promise they unbound him and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find himself out of 
the cage the first thing he did was to make don quixote take off his armour and lead him in 
that tight chamois suit we have already described and depicted more than once out on a 
balcony overhanging one of the chief streets of the city in full view of the crowd and of 
the boys who gazed at him as they would at a monkey the cavaliers in livery careered before 
him again as though it were for him alone and not to enliven the festival of the day that 
they wore it and sancho was in high delight for it seemed to him that there was no story or 
event in the world that he had not at his fingers ends and fixed in his memory and he said 
to him in truth master if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home and give over roaming 
mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit looking for what they say are called adventures 
but what i call misfortunes i shall have to make complaint to god and the king with loud 
supplication to send some remedy to which don quixote replied what answer god will give 
to your complaints housekeeper i know not nor what his majesty will answer either i only 
know that if i were king i should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions they 
present every day for one of the greatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged 
to listen to all and answer all and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of mine 
should worry him whereupon the housekeeper said tell us senor at his majestys court are 
there no knights there are replied don quixote and plenty of them and it is right there 
should be to set off the dignity of the prince and for the greater glory of the kings majesty 
then might not your worship said she be one of those that without stirring a step serve 
their king and lord in his court recollect my friend said don quixote all the time with 
his fingers to his nose and for the future pay more attention to thy person and to what thou 
owest to mine for it is my great familiarity with thee that has bred this contempt ill bet 
replied sancho that your worship thinks i have done something i ought not with my person 
it makes it worse to stir it the squire of the grove took sancho by the arm saying to him let 
us two go where we can talk in squire style as much as we please and leave these gentlemen 
our masters to fight it out over the story of their loves and depend upon it daybreak will 
find them at it without having made an end of it so be it by all means said the man with the 
patch ill lower the price and be well satisfied if i only pay my expenses and now ill go back 
and hurry on the cart with the ape and the show and with this he went out of the inn don quixote 
at once asked the landlord what this master pedro was and what was the divining ape that 
astonished all the villages with his divinations he says then that he who has read the 
first part of this history will remember well enough the gines de pasamonte whom with 
other galley slaves don quixote set free in the sierra morena a kindness for which he afterwards 
got poor thanks and worse payment from that evilminded illconditioned set this gines 
de pasamontedon ginesillo de parapilla don quixote called himit was that stole dapple 
from sancho panza which because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when 
was stated in the first part has been a puzzle to a good many people who attribute to the 
bad memory of the author what was the error of the press in fact however gines stole him 
while sancho panza was asleep on his back adopting the plan and device that brunello had 
recourse to when he stole sacripantes horse from between his legs at the siege of albracca 
and as has been told sancho afterwards recovered him this gines then afraid of being caught 
by the officers of justice who were looking for him to punish him for his numberless rascalities 
and offences which were so many and so great that he himself wrote a big book giving an account 
of them resolved to shift his quarters into the kingdom of aragon and cover up his left 
eye and take up the trade of a puppetshowman for this as well as juggling he knew how to practise 
to perfection from some released christians returning from barbary it so happened he 
bought the ape which he taught to mount upon his shoulder on his making a certain sign and 
to whisper or seem to do so in his ear thus prepared before entering any village whither 
he was bound with his show and his ape he used to inform himself at the nearest village or 
from the most likely person he could find as to what particular things had happened there 
and to whom and bearing them well in mind the first thing he did was to embrace me closely 
and then he said to me for a long time now o valiant knight don quixote of la mancha is established 
for ever don quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess and having supped retired to his 
chamber alone refusing to allow anyone to enter with him to wait on him such was his fear 
of encountering temptations that might lead or drive him to forget his chaste fidelity 
to his lady dulcinea for he had always present to his mind the virtue of amadis that flower 
and mirror of knightserrant he locked the door behind him and by the light of two wax candles 
undressed himself but as he was taking off his stockingso disaster unworthy of such a 
personagethere came a burst not of sighs or anything belying his delicacy or good breeding 
but of some two dozen stitches in one of his stockings that made it look like a windowlattice 
the worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed and at that moment he would have given 
an ounce of silver to have had half a drachm of green silk there i say green silk because 
the stockings were green here cide hamete exclaimed as he was writing o poverty poverty 
i know not what could have led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories 
when he had so much to write about in mine no doubt he must have gone by the proverb with straw 
or with hay etc for by merely setting forth my thoughts my sighs my tears my lofty purposes 
my enterprises he might have made a volume as large or larger than all the works of el tostado 
would make up in fact the conclusion i arrive at senor bachelor is that to write histories 
or books of any kind there is need of great judgment and a ripe understanding to give expression 
to humour and write in a strain of graceful pleasantry is the gift of great geniuses the 
cleverest character in comedy is the clown for he who would make people take him for a fool 
must not be one history is in a measure a sacred thing for it should be true and where the 
truth is there god is but notwithstanding this there are some who write and fling books 
broadcast on the world as if they were fritters there is no book so bad but it has something 
good in it said the bachelor no doubt of that replied don quixote but it often happens that 
those who have acquired and attained a welldeserved reputation by their writings lose 
it entirely or damage it in some degree when they give them to the press the reason of that 
said samson is that as printed works are examined leisurely their faults are easily seen 
and the greater the fame of the writer the more closely are they scrutinised men famous 
for their genius great poets illustrious historians are always or most commonly envied 
by those who take a particular delight and pleasure in criticising the writings of others 
without having produced any of their own that is no wonder said don quixote for there are 
many divines who are no good for the pulpit but excellent in detecting the defects or excesses 
of those who preach all that is true senor don quixote said carrasco but i wish such faultfinders 
were more lenient and less exacting and did not pay so much attention to the spots on the 
bright sun of the work they grumble at for if aliquando bonus dormitat homerus they should 
remember how long he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade as 
possible and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be moles that sometimes 
heighten the beauty of the face that bears them and so i say very great is the risk to which 
he who prints a book exposes himself for of all impossibilities the greatest is that a 
play endowed with all these qualities will not entertain satisfy and please much more 
than one wanting in them like the greater number of those which are commonly acted nowadays 
nor are the poets who write them to be blamed for this for some there are among them who are 
perfectly well aware of their faults and know what they ought to do but as plays have become 
a salable commodity they say and with truth that the actors will not buy them unless they 
are after this fashion and so the poet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the 
actor who is to pay him for his work and that this is the truth may be seen by the countless 
plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written with so much brilliancy so 
much grace and gaiety such polished versification such choice language such profound 
reflections and in a word so rich in eloquence and elevation of style that he has filled 
the world with his fame and yet in consequence of his desire to suit the taste of the actors 
they have not all as some of them have come as near perfection as they ought others write 
plays with such heedlessness that after they have been acted the actors have to fly and 
abscond afraid of being punished as they often have been for having acted something offensive 
to some king or other or insulting to some noble family all which evils and many more that 
i say nothing of would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at 
the capital to examine all plays before they were acted not only those produced in the 
capital itself but all that were intended to be acted in spain without whose approval 
seal and signature no local magistracy should allow any play to be acted in that case actors 
would take care to send their plays to the capital and could act them in safety and those 
who write them would be more careful and take more pains with their work standing in awe 
of having to submit it to the strict examination of one who understood the matter and so 
good plays would be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained as well the amusement 
of the people as the credit of the wits of spain the interest and safety of the actors and 
the saving of trouble in inflicting punishment on them and if the same or some other person 
were authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry no doubt some would appear 
with all the perfections you have described enriching our language with the gracious 
and precious treasure of eloquence and driving the old books into obscurity before the 
light of the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment not merely of 
the idle but of the very busiest for the bow cannot be always bent nor can weak human nature 
exist without some lawful amusement the canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with 
their conversation when the barber coming forward joined them and said to the curate 
this is the spot senor licentiate that i said was a good one for fresh and plentiful pasture 
for the oxen while we take our noontide rest and so it seems returned the curate and he told 
the canon what he proposed to do on which he too made up his mind to halt with them attracted 
by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes and to enjoy it as well as the 
conversation of the curate to whom he had begun to take a fancy and also to learn more particulars 
about the doings of don quixote he desired some of his servants to go on to the inn which 
was not far distant and fetch from it what eatables there might be for the whole party as 
he meant to rest for the afternoon where he was to which one of his servants replied that 
the sumpter mule which by this time ought to have reached the inn carried provisions enough 
to make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley in that case said the 
canon take all the beasts there and bring the sumpter mule back while this was going on 
sancho perceiving that he could speak to his master without having the curate and the 
barber of whom he had his suspicions present all the time approached the cage in which 
don quixote was placed and said senor to ease my conscience i want to tell you the state 
of the case as to your enchantment and that is that these two here with their faces covered 
are the curate of our village and the barber and i suspect they have hit upon this plan of 
carrying you off in this fashion out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them 
in doing famous deeds and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted but 
gone wrong in your wits ask what thou wilt sancho my son returned don quixote for i will 
satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest as to what thou sayest that these who accompany 
us yonder are the curate and the barber our neighbours and acquaintances it is very possible 
that they may seem to be those same persons but that they are so in reality and in fact believe 
it not on any account what thou art to believe and think is that if they look like them as 
thou sayest it must be that those who have enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness 
for it is easy for enchanters to take any form they please and they may have taken those 
of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost and lead thee into a labyrinth of 
fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though thou hadst the cord of theseus and they 
may also have done it to make me uncertain in my mind and unable to conjecture whence this 
evil comes to me for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate of our 
village are here in company with us and on the other i find myself shut up in a cage and know 
in my heart that no power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut 
me in what wouldst thou have me say or think but that my enchantment is of a sort that transcends 
all i have ever read of in all the histories that deal with knightserrant that have been 
enchanted so thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest 
for they are as much so as i am a turk but touching thy desire to ask me something say on and 
i will answer thee though thou shouldst ask questions from this till tomorrow morning 
may our lady be good to me said sancho lifting up his voice and is it possible that your worship 
is so thick of skull and so short of brains that you cannot see that what i say is true mount 
thy ass and follow them quietly and thou shalt see that when they have gone some little 
distance from this they will return to their original shape and ceasing to be sheep become 
men in all respects as i described them to thee at first but go not just yet for i want thy 
help and assistance come hither and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing for 
i feel as if there was not one left in my mouth sancho came so close that he almost put his 
eyes into his mouth now just at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of don quixote 
so at the very instant when sancho came to examine his mouth he discharged all its contents 
with more force than a musket and full into the beard of the compassionate squire holy 
mary cried sancho what is this that has happened me clearly this sinner is mortally wounded 
as he vomits blood from the mouth but considering the matter a little more closely he perceived 
by the colour taste and smell that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask which he 
had seen him drink and he was taken with such a loathing that his stomach turned and he vomited 
up his inside over his very master and both were left in a precious state sancho ran to his 
ass to get something wherewith to clean himself and relieve his master out of his alforjas 
but not finding them he wellnigh took leave of his senses and cursed himself anew and in 
his heart resolved to dub him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself 
feeling sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him in the course 
of the altercation among other things the barber said gentlemen this packsaddle is mine 
as surely as i owe god a death and i know it as well as if i had given birth to it and here is my 
ass in the stable who will not let me lie only try it and if it does not fit him like a glove 
call me a rascal and what is more the same day i was robbed of this they robbed me likewise 
of a new brass basin never yet handselled that would fetch a crown any day at this don quixote 
could not keep himself from answering and interposing between the two and separating 
them he placed the packsaddle on the ground to lie there in sight until the truth was established 
and said your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this worthy 
squire lies when he calls a basin which was is and shall be the helmet of mambrino which 
i won from him in air war and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession 
with the packsaddle i do not concern myself but i may tell you on that head that my squire 
sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroons steed 
and with it adorn his own i allowed him and he took it and as to its having been changed from 
a caparison into a packsaddle i can give no explanation except the usual one that such 
transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry to confirm all which run sancho 
my son and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin egad master said 
sancho if we have no other proof of our case than what your worship puts forward mambrinos 
helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellows caparison is a packsaddle do as i bid 
thee said don quixote it cannot be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment 
sancho hastened to where the basin was and brought it back with him and when don quixote 
saw it he took hold of it and said your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert 
that this is a basin and not the helmet i told you of and i swear by the order of chivalry i 
profess that this helmet is the identical one i took from him without anything added to 
or taken from it there is no doubt of that said sancho for from the time my master won it until 
now he has only fought one battle in it when he let loose those unlucky men in chains and 
if had not been for this basinhelmet he would not have come off over well that time for there 
was plenty of stonethrowing in that affair chapter xlv in which the doubtful question 
of mambrinos helmet and the packsaddle is finally settled with other adventures that 
occurred in truth and earnest what do you think now gentlemen said the barber of what these 
gentles say when they want to make out that this is a helmet and whoever says the contrary 
said don quixote i will let him know he lies if he is a knight and if he is a squire that he lies 
again a thousand times our own barber who was present at all this and understood don quixotes 
humour so thoroughly took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke 
for the general amusement so addressing the other barber he said senor barber or whatever 
you are you must know that i belong to your profession too and have had a licence to practise 
for more than twenty years and i know the implements of the barber craft every one of them 
perfectly well and i was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth and i know 
also what a helmet is and a morion and a headpiece with a visor and other things pertaining 
to soldiering i meant to say to soldiers arms and i saysaving better opinions and always 
with submission to sounder judgmentsthat this piece we have now before us which this 
worthy gentleman has in his hands not only is no barbers basin but is as far from being one 
as white is from black and truth from falsehood i say moreover that this although it is 
a helmet is not a complete helmet certainly not said don quixote for half of it is wanting 
that is to say the beaver it is quite true said the curate who saw the object of his friend 
the barber and cardenio don fernando and his companions agreed with him and even the judge 
if his thoughts had not been so full of don luiss affair would have helped to carry on the 
joke but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little 
or no attention to these facetious proceedings god bless me exclaimed their butt the 
barber at this is it possible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a 
basin but a helmet why this is a thing that would astonish a whole university however wise 
it might be that will do if this basin is a helmet why then the packsaddle must be a horses 
caparison as this gentleman has said to me it looks like a packsaddle said don quixote 
but i have already told thee there are many sorts of enchantments and it may be that in the 
course of time they have been changed one for another and that now it may be the way with 
enchanted people to do all that i do though they did not do so before so it is vain to argue 
or draw inferences against the usage of the time i know and feel that i am enchanted and 
that is enough to ease my conscience for it would weigh heavily on it if i thought that i 
was not enchanted and that in a fainthearted and cowardly way i allowed myself to lie in 
this cage defrauding multitudes of the succour i might afford to those in need and distress 
who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection still for all that replied 
sancho i say that for your greater and fuller satisfaction it would be well if your worship 
were to try to get out of this prison and i promise to do all in my power to help and even to 
take you out of it and see if you could once more mount your good rocinante who seems to be 
enchanted too he is so melancholy and dejected and then we might try our chance in looking 
for adventures again and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the cage 
in which on the faith of a good and loyal squire i promise to shut myself up along with your 
worship if so be you are so unfortunate or i so stupid as not to be able to carry out my plan 
i am content to do as thou sayest brother sancho said don quixote and when thou seest an 
opportunity for effecting my release i will obey thee absolutely but thou wilt see sancho 
how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my misfortune the knighterrant and the illerrant 
squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the curate the canon 
and the barber who had already dismounted were waiting for them the carter at once unyoked 
the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot the freshness of which 
seemed to invite not enchanted people like don quixote but wideawake sensible folk like 
his squire who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little for if 
they did not let him out he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils 
unless they kept their distance the canon took his hand tied together as they both were 
and on his word and promise they unbound him and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find 
himself out of the cage the first thing he did was to exhibit his show sometimes one story 
sometimes another but all lively amusing and familiar as soon as the exhibition was over 
he brought forward the accomplishments of his ape assuring the public that he divined 
all the past and the present but as to the future he had no skill for each question answered 
he asked two reals and for some he made a reduction just as he happened to feel the pulse 
of the questioners and when now and then he came to houses where things that he knew of had 
happened to the people living there even if they did not ask him a question not caring to 
pay for it he would make the sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so which 
fitted the case exactly in this way he acquired a prodigious name and all ran after him 
on other occasions being very crafty he would answer in such a way that the men of the braying 
town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known from whites and the unlucky joke has 
gone so far that several times the scoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle 
with the scoffers and neither king nor rook fear nor shame can mend matters tomorrow or 
the day after i believe the men of my town that is of the braying town are going to take the 
field against another village two leagues away from ours one of those that persecute 
us most and that we may turn out well prepared i have bought these lances and halberds you 
have seen these are the curious things i told you i had to tell and if you dont think them 
so i have got no others and with this the worthy fellow brought his story to a close just 
at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn which was still shut on seeing which don 
quixote even there where he was did not forget to act as sentinel and said in a loud and imperious 
tone knights or squires or whatever ye be ye have no right to knock at the gates of this castle 
for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it don fernando parted the officer and don 
quixote and to their mutual contentment made them relax the grip by which they held the 
one the coat collar the other the throat of his adversary for all this however the officers 
did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help and deliver him over bound 
into their power as was required for the service of the king and of the holy brotherhood 
on whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber 
and footpad of the highways don quixote smiled when he heard these words and said very 
calmly come now base illborn brood call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to those 
in bondage to release the captives to succour the miserable to raise up the fallen to relieve 
the needy infamous beings who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven 
should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knighterrantry or show you the sin 
and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow not to say the presence 
of any knighterrant come now band not of officers but of thieves footpads with the licence 
of the holy brotherhood tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against 
such a knight as i am who was he that did not know that knightserrant are independent of 
all jurisdictions that their law is their sword their charter their prowess and their 
edicts their will who i say again was the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent 
of nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as a knighterrant acquires the 
day he is dubbed a knight and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry what knighterrant 
ever paid polltax duty queens pinmoney kings dues toll or ferry what tailor ever took 
payment of him for making his clothes what castellan that received him in his castle ever 
made him pay his shot what king did not seat him at his table what damsel was not enamoured 
of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure and lastly what knighterrant 
has there been is there or will there ever be in the world not bold enough to give singlehanded 
four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the holy brotherhood if they come 
in his way chapter xlvi of the end of the notable adventure of the officers of the holy brotherhood 
and of the great ferocity of our worthy knight don quixote while don quixote was talking 
in this strain the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of 
his senses as they might perceive by his deeds and his words and that they need not press 
the matter any further for even if they arrested him and carried him off they would have 
to release him byandby as a madman to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had 
nothing to do with inquiring into don quixotes madness but only to execute his superiors 
orders and that once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked for all 
that said the curate you must not take him away this time nor will he it is my opinion let 
himself be taken away in short the curate used such arguments and don quixote did such 
mad things that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they had not perceived 
his want of wits and so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified and even 
to act as peacemakers between the barber and sancho panza who still continued their altercation 
with much bitterness in the end they as officers of justice settled the question by arbitration 
in such a manner that both sides were if not perfectly contented at least to some extent 
satisfied for they changed the packsaddles but not the girths or headstalls and as to 
mambrinos helmet the curate under the rose and without don quixotes knowing it paid eight 
reals for the basin and the barber executed a full receipt and engagement to make no further 
demand then or thenceforth for evermore amen these two disputes which were the most important 
and gravest being settled it only remained for the servants of don luis to consent that 
three of them should return while one was left to accompany him whither don fernando desired 
to take him and good luck and better fortune having already begun to solve difficulties 
and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and warriors of the inn were pleased to 
persevere and bring everything to a happy issue for the servants agreed to do as don luis 
wished which gave dona clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her face 
just then without seeing the joy of her heart zoraida though she did not fully comprehend 
all she saw was grave or gay without knowing why as she watched and studied the various 
countenances but particularly her spaniards whom she followed with her eyes and clung 
to with her soul the gift and compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped 
the landlords notice and he demanded don quixotes reckoning together with the amount 
of the damage to his wineskins and the loss of his wine swearing that neither rocinante 
nor sanchos ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the very last farthing the 
curate settled all amicably and don fernando paid though the judge had also very readily 
offered to pay the score and all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded 
one of the discord of agramantes camp and in a voice that shook the inn like thunder he cried 
out hold all let all sheathe their swords let all be calm and attend to me as they value their 
lives all paused at his mighty voice and he went on to say did i not tell you sirs that this 
castle was enchanted and that a legion or so of devils dwelt in it in proof whereof i call 
upon you to behold with your own eyes how the discord of agramantes camp has come hither 
and been transferred into the midst of us see how they fight there for the sword here for 
the horse on that side for the eagle on this for the helmet we are all fighting and all at 
cross purposes come then you senor judge and you senor curate let the one represent king 
agramante and the other king sobrino and make peace among us for by god almighty it is a 
sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one another for such 
trifling cause the officers who did not understand don quixotes mode of speaking and 
found themselves roughly handled by don fernando cardenio and their companions were 
not to be appeased the barber was however for both his beard and his packsaddle were the 
worse for the struggle sancho like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master 
while the four servants of don luis kept quiet when they saw how little they gained by not 
being so the landlord alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this 
madman who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn but at length the uproar was stilled 
for the present the packsaddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment and the basin 
a helmet and the inn a castle in don quixotes imagination all having been now pacified 
and made friends by the persuasion of the judge and the curate the servants of don luis 
began again to urge him to return with them at once and while he was discussing the matter 
with them the judge took counsel with don fernando cardenio and the curate however greeted 
him in a more intelligible and polished style in short the judge made his entrance in a 
state of bewilderment as well with what he saw as what he heard and the fair ladies of the 
inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome on the whole he could perceive that all who were 
there were people of quality but with the figure countenance and bearing of don quixote 
he was at his wits end and all civilities having been exchanged and the accommodation 
of the inn inquired into it was settled as it had been before settled that all the women 
should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned and that the men should remain 
outside as if to guard them the judge therefore was very well pleased to allow his daughter 
for such the damsel was to go with the ladies which she did very willingly and with part 
of the hosts narrow bed and half of what the judge had brought with him they made a more comfortable 
arrangement for the night than they had expected the captive whose heart had leaped within 
him the instant he saw the judge telling him somehow that this was his brother asked one 
of the servants who accompanied him what his name was and where he had studied he replied 
my name senor governor is doctor pedro recio de aguero i am a native of a place called tirteafuera 
which lies between caracuel and almodovar del campo on the righthand side and i have the 
degree of doctor from the university of osuna to which sancho glowing all over with rage 
returned then let doctor pedro recio de malaguero native of tirteafuera a place thats 
on the righthand side as we go from caracuel to almodovar del campo graduate of osuna get 
out of my presence at once or i swear by the sun ill take a cudgel and by dint of blows beginning 
with him ill not leave a doctor in the whole island at least of those i know to be ignorant 
for as to learned wise sensible physicians them i will reverence and honour as divine 
persons once more i say let pedro recio get out of this or ill take this chair i am sitting 
on and break it over his head and if they call me to account for it ill clear myself by saying 
i served god in killing a bad doctora general executioner and now give me something to 
eat and let me go at once for i mean to return this evening come and do penance with me said 
the curate at this for senora teresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest 
the page refused but had to consent at last for his own sake and the curate took him home 
with him very gladly in order to have an opportunity of questioning him at leisure about 
don quixote and his doings the bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for teresa 
but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affairs for she thought him somewhat 
given to joking and so she gave a cake and a couple of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman 
and he wrote for her two letters one for her husband and the other for the duchess dictated 
out of her own head which are not the worst inserted in this great history as will be seen 
farther on chapter xi of the strange adventure which the valiant don quixote had in the 
terrible and undreamtof adventure of the windmills with other occurrences worthy to 
be fitly recorded at this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there 
are on plain and as soon as don quixote saw him he asked him can you tell me worthy friend 
and god speed you whereabouts here is the palace of the peerless princess dona dulcinea 
del toboso senor replied the lad i am a stranger and i have been only a few days in the town 
doing farm work for a rich farmer in that house opposite there live the curate of the village 
and the sacristan and both or either of them will be able to give your worship some account 
of this lady princess for they have a list of all the people of el toboso though it is my belief 
there is not a princess living in the whole of it many ladies there are of quality and in 
her own house each of them may be a princess well then she i am inquiring for will be one of 
these my friend said don quixote may be so replied the lad god be with you for here comes 
the daylight and without waiting for any more of his questions he whipped on his mules 
sancho seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied said to him senor daylight 
will be here before long and he is a very intelligent youth and deep in love and what is more 
he can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection the goatherd had hardly done 
speaking when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears and shortly after the player 
came up a very goodlooking young man of about twoandtwenty his comrades asked him if he 
had supped and on his replying that he had he who had already made the offer said to him in 
that case antonio thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing a little that the gentleman 
our guest may see that even in the mountains and woods there are musicians we have told 
him of thy accomplishments and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true so as 
thou livest pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary 
made thee and that was so much liked in the town with all my heart said the tailor and drawing 
his hand from under his cloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of it and said 
there are the caps this good man asks for and by god and upon my conscience said the devil 
i never observed it for my mind is occupied with so many different things that i was forgetting 
the main thing i came about this demon must be an honest fellow and a good soul the first 
thing he said was which is the lord governor here which should it be said the secretary 
but he who is seated in the chair then i humble myself before him said the farmer and going 
on his knees he asked for his hand to kiss it sancho refused it and bade him stand up and say 
what he wanted the farmer obeyed and then said i am a farmer senor a native of miguelturra 
a village two leagues from ciudad real another tirteafuera said sancho say on brother 
i know miguelturra very well i can tell you for its not very far from my own town the case 
is this senor continued the farmer that by gods mercy i am married with the leave and licence 
of the holy roman catholic church i have two sons students and the younger is studying 
to become bachelor and the elder to be licentiate i am a widower for my wife died or more 
properly speaking a bad doctor killed her on my hands giving her a purge when she was with 
child and if it had pleased god that the child had been born and was a boy i would have put 
him to study for doctor that he might not envy his brothers the bachelor and the licentiate 
so that if your wife had not died or had not been killed you would not now be a widower said 
sancho no senor certainly not said the farmer weve got that much settled said sancho get 
on brother for its more bedtime than businesstime well then said the farmer this son of 
mine who is going to be a bachelor fell in love in the said town with a damsel called clara 
perlerina daughter of andres perlerino a very rich farmer and this name of perlerines 
does not come to them by ancestry or descent but because all the family are paralytics 
and for a better name they call them perlerines though to tell the truth the damsel is as 
fair as an oriental pearl and like a flower of the field if you look at her on the right side 
on the left not so much for on that side she wants an eye that she lost by smallpox and though 
her face is thickly and deeply pitted those who love her say they are not pits that are there 
but the graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried she is so cleanly that not to soil 
her face she carries her nose turned up as they say so that one would fancy it was running 
away from her mouth and with all this she looks extremely well for she has a wide mouth and 
but for wanting ten or a dozen teeth and grinders she might compare and compete with the 
comeliest of her lips i say nothing for they are so fine and thin that if lips might be reeled 
one might make a skein of them but being of a different colour from ordinary lips they are 
wonderful for they are mottled blue green and purplelet my lord the governor pardon me 
for painting so minutely the charms of her who some time or other will be my daughter for 
i love her and i dont find her amiss paint what you will said sancho i enjoy your painting 
and if i had dined there could be no dessert more to my taste than your portrait that i have 
still to furnish said the farmer but a time will come when we shall become acquainted and 
meet one another but god knows the future commend me to your daughter sanchica and tell 
her from me to hold herself in readiness for i mean to make a high match for her when she least 
expects it they tell me there are big acorns in your village send me a couple of dozen or 
so and i shall value them greatly as coming from your hand and write to me at length to assure 
me of your health and wellbeing and if there be anything you stand in need of it is but to 
open your mouth and that shall be the measure and so god keep you from this place your loving 
friend the duchess ah what a good plain lowly lady said teresa when she heard the letter 
that i may be buried with ladies of that sort and not the gentlewomen we have in this town 
that fancy because they are gentlewomen the wind must not touch them and go to church with 
as much airs as if they were queens no less and seem to think they are disgraced if they look 
at a farmers wife and see here how this good lady for all shes a duchess calls me friend and 
treats me as if i was her equaland equal may i see her with the tallest churchtower in la 
mancha and as for the acorns senor ill send her ladyship a peck and such big ones that one 
might come to see them as a show and a wonder and now sanchica see that the gentleman is comfortable 
put up his horse and get some eggs out of the stable and cut plenty of bacon and lets give 
him his dinner like a prince for the good news he has brought and his own bonny face deserve 
it all and meanwhile ill run out and give the neighbours the news of our good luck and father 
curate and master nicholas the barber who are and always have been such friends of thy 
fathers that i will mother said sanchica but mind you must give me half of that string for 
i dont think my lady the duchess could have been so stupid as to send it all to you it is all 
for thee my child said teresa but let me wear it round my neck for a few days for verily it 
seems to make my heart glad you will be glad too said the page when you see the bundle there 
is in this portmanteau for it is a suit of the finest cloth that the governor only wore one 
day out hunting and now sends all for senora sanchica may he live a thousand years said 
sanchica and the bearer as many nay two thousand if needful with this teresa hurried out 
of the house with the letters and with the string of beads round her neck and went along 
thrumming the letters as if they were a tambourine and by chance coming across the curate 
and samson carrasco she began capering and saying none of us poor now faith weve got a little 
government ay let the finest fine lady tackle me and ill give her a setting down whats all 
this teresa panza said they what madness is this and what papers are those the madness 
is only this said she that these are the letters of duchesses and governors and these i 
have on my neck are fine coral beads with avemarias and paternosters of beaten gold and 
i am a governess god help us said the curate we dont understand you teresa or know what you 
are talking about there you may see it yourselves said teresa and she handed them the letters 
the curate read them out for samson carrasco to hear and samson and he regarded one another 
with looks of astonishment at what they had read and the bachelor asked who had brought 
the letters teresa in reply bade them come with her to her house and they would see the messenger 
a most elegant youth who had brought another present which was worth as much more the curate 
took the coral beads from her neck and examined them again and again and having satisfied 
himself as to their fineness he fell to wondering afresh and said by the gown i wear i dont 
know what to say for i am ready to swear i left him shut up in the casa del nuncio at toledo 
and here another don quixote turns up though a very different one from mine i dont know 
whether i am good said don quixote but i can safely say i am not the bad and to prove it let 
me tell you senor don quixote it is one of the bestworthseeing things in the world this 
day but operibus credite et non verbis and now lets get to work for it is growing late and 
we have a great deal to do and to say and show don quixote and sancho obeyed him and went to 
where the show was already put up and uncovered set all around with lighted wax tapers 
which made it look splendid and bright when they came to it master pedro ensconced himself 
inside it for it was he who had to work the puppets and a boy a servant of his posted himself 
outside to act as showman and explain the mysteries of the exhibition having a wand in 
his hand to point to the figures as they came out and so all who were in the inn being arranged 
in front of the show some of them standing and don quixote sancho the page and cousin accommodated 
with the best places the interpreter began to say what he will hear or see who reads or hears 
the next chapter chapter xxvi wherein is continued the droll adventure of the puppetshowman 
together with other things in truth right good chapter xxvii wherein it is shown who master 
pedro and his ape were together with the mishap don quixote had in the braying adventure 
which he did not conclude as he would have liked or as he had expected chapter xxviii of 
matters that benengeli says he who reads them will know if he reads them with attention 
when the brave man flees treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to reserve themselves 
for better occasions this proved to be the case with don quixote who giving way before 
the fury of the townsfolk and the hostile intentions of the angry troop took to flight 
and without a thought of sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him retreated to such 
a distance as he thought made him safe sancho lying across his ass followed him as has been 
said and at length came up having by this time recovered his senses and on joining him let 
himself drop off dapple at rocinantes feet sore bruised and belaboured don quixote dismounted 
to examine his wounds but finding him whole from head to foot he said to him angrily enough 
in an evil hour didst thou take to braying sancho where hast thou learned that it is well 
done to mention the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged to the music of brays 
what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels give thanks to god sancho that they 
signed the cross on thee just now with a stick and did not mark thee per signum crucis with 
a cutlass im not equal to answering said sancho for i feel as if i was speaking through my 
shoulders let us mount and get away from this ill keep from braying but not from saying 
that knightserrant fly and leave their good squires to be pounded like privet or made 
meal of at the hands of their enemies he does not fly who retires returned don quixote for 
i would have thee know sancho that the valour which is not based upon a foundation of prudence 
is called rashness and the exploits of the rash man are to be attributed rather to good 
fortune than to courage and so i own that i retired but not that i fled and therein i have 
followed the example of many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times 
the histories are full of instances of this but as it would not be any good to thee or pleasure 
to me i will not recount them to thee now sancho was by this time mounted with the help of 
don quixote who then himself mounted rocinante and at a leisurely pace they proceeded 
to take shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off every now and 
then sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans and on don quixote asking him what 
caused such acute suffering he replied that from the end of his backbone up to the nape 
of his neck he was so sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses the cause of that soreness 
said don quixote will be no doubt that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very 
long one it caught thee all down the back where all the parts that are sore are situated 
and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still by god said sancho your worship 
gives me a nice authority for what you say putrid dolly something transmogrified or whatever 
it is don quixote laughed at the interpretation sancho put upon computed and the name 
of the cosmographer ptolemy and said he thou must know sancho that with the spaniards 
and those who embark at cadiz for the east indies one of the signs they have to show them 
when they have passed the equinoctial line i told thee of is that the lice die upon everybody 
on board the ship and not a single one is left or to be found in the whole vessel if they gave 
its weight in gold for it so sancho thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh and if 
thou comest upon anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt if not then we have crossed 
i dont believe a bit of it said sancho still ill do as your worship bids me though i dont know 
what need there is for trying these experiments for i can see with my own eyes that we have 
not moved five yards away from the bank or shifted two yards from where the animals stand 
for there are rocinante and dapple in the very same place where we left them and watching 
a point as i do now i swear by all thats good to fill your margins and use up four sheets at 
the end of the book now let us come to those references to authors which other books have 
and you want for yours the remedy for this is very simple you have only to look out for some 
book that quotes them all from a to z as you say yourself and then insert the very same alphabet 
in your book and though the imposition may be plain to see because you have so little need 
to borrow from them that is no matter there will probably be some simple enough to believe 
that you have made use of them all in this plain artless story of yours at any rate if it answers 
no other purpose this long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of 
authority to your book besides no one will trouble himself to verify whether you have 
followed them or whether you have not being no way concerned in it especially as if i mistake 
not this book of yours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants for it is from 
beginning to end an attack upon the books of chivalry of which aristotle never dreamt 
nor st basil said a word nor cicero had any knowledge nor do the niceties of truth nor the 
observations of astrology come within the range of its fanciful vagaries nor have geometrical 
measurements or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to do with it 
nor does it mean to preach to anybody mixing up things human and divine a sort of motley 
in which no christian understanding should dress itself it has only to avail itself of 
truth to nature in its composition and the more perfect the imitation the better the work 
will be and as this piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the authority and 
influence which books of chivalry have in the world and with the public there is no need 
for you to go abegging for aphorisms from philosophers precepts from holy scripture 
fables from poets speeches from orators or miracles from saints but merely to take care 
that your style and diction run musically pleasantly and plainly with clear proper and 
wellplaced words setting forth your purpose to the best of your power and putting your 
ideas intelligibly without confusion or obscurity strive too that in reading your story 
the melancholy may be moved to laughter and the merry made merrier still that the simple 
shall not be wearied that the judicious shall admire the invention that the grave shall 
not despise it nor the wise fail to praise it finally keep your aim fixed on the destruction 
of that illfounded edifice of the books of chivalry hated by some and praised by many more 
for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no small success in profound silence 
i listened to what my friend said and his observations made such an impression on me that 
without attempting to question them i admitted their soundness and out of them i determined 
to make this preface wherein gentle reader thou wilt perceive my friends good sense my 
good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a time of need and what thou hast gained 
in receiving without addition or alteration the story of the famous don quixote of la 
mancha and he says they mention me in it by my own name of sancho panza and the lady dulcinea 
del toboso too and divers things that happened to us when we were alone so that i crossed 
myself in my wonder how the historian who wrote them down could have known them i promise 
thee sancho said don quixote the author of my history was no sage but some ignorant chatterer 
who in a haphazard and heedless way set about writing it let it turn out as it might just 
as orbaneja the painter of ubeda used to do who when they asked him what he was painting 
used to say whatever it may turn out and if he chanced to paint a cock he would write under 
it this is a cock for fear they might think it was a fox the painter or writer for its all the 
same who published the history of this new don quixote that has come out must have been 
one of this sort i think sancho for he painted or wrote whatever it might turn out or perhaps 
he is like a poet called mauleon that was about the court some years ago who used to answer 
at haphazard whatever he was asked and on one asking him what deum de deo meant he replied 
de donde diere but putting this aside tell me sancho hast thou a mind to have another turn 
at thyself tonight and wouldst thou rather have it indoors or in the open air egad senor 
said sancho for what im going to give myself it comes all the same to me whether it be over 
a wall or at a window or through the chink of a door or the grate of a garden for any beam of 
the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light to my reason and strength to my 
heart so that i shall be unmatched and unequalled in wisdom and valour well to tell the 
truth senor said sancho when i saw that sun of the lady dulcinea del toboso it was not bright 
enough to throw out beams at all it must have been that as her grace was sifting that wheat 
i told you of the thick dust she raised came before her face like a cloud and dimmed it what 
dost thou still persist sancho said don quixote in saying thinking believing and maintaining 
that my lady dulcinea was sifting wheat that being an occupation and task entirely at 
variance with what is and should be the employment of persons of distinction who are constituted 
and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show their rank a bowshot off thou 
hast forgotten o sancho those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how in their crystal 
abodes those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved tagus and seated 
themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which the ingenious poet there 
describes to us how they were worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls and something 
of this sort must have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her only that the 
spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes all 
those things that give me pleasure and turns them into shapes unlike their own and so i 
fear that in that history of my achievements which they say is now in print if haply its 
author was some sage who is an enemy of mine he will have put one thing for another mingling 
a thousand lies with one truth and amusing himself by relating transactions which have 
nothing to do with the sequence of a true history o envy root of all countless evils and 
cankerworm of the virtues all the vices sancho bring some kind of pleasure with them but 
envy brings nothing but irritation bitterness and rage so i say too replied sancho and 
i suspect in that legend or history of us that the bachelor samson carrasco told us he saw 
my honour goes dragged in the dirt knocked about up and down sweeping the streets as they 
say and yet on the faith of an honest man i never spoke ill of any enchanter and i am not so 
well off that i am to be envied to be sure i am rather sly and i have a certain spice of the rogue 
in me but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity always natural and never acted 
and if i had no other merit save that i believe as i always do firmly and truly in god and all 
the holy roman catholic church holds and believes and that i am a mortal enemy of the jews 
the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings but let them 
say what they like of me that sancho returned don quixote reminds me of what happened to 
a famous poet of our own day who having written a bitter satire against all the courtesan 
ladies did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she 
was one or not she seeing she was not in the list of the poet asked him what he had seen in her 
that he did not include her in the number of the others telling him he must add to his satire 
and put her in the new part or else look out for the consequences the poet did as she bade 
him and left her without a shred of reputation and she was satisfied by getting fame though 
it was infamy in keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who set fire to the 
famous temple of diana by repute one of the seven wonders of the world and burned it with 
the sole object of making his name live in after ages and though it was forbidden to name 
him or mention his name by word of mouth or in writing lest the object of his ambition should 
be attained nevertheless it became known that he was called erostratus and something 
of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great emperor charles v and a gentleman 
in rome the emperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the rotunda called in ancient 
times the temple of all the gods but nowadays by a better nomenclature of all the saints 
which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan construction in rome and the 
one which best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its founders 
it is in the form of a half orange of enormous dimensions and well lighted though no light 
penetrates it save that which is admitted by a window or rather round skylight at the top 
and it was from this that the emperor examined the building a roman gentleman stood by 
his side and explained to him the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric 
and its wonderful architecture and when they had left the skylight he said to the emperor 
a thousand times your sacred majesty the impulse came upon me to seize your majesty in 
my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight so as to leave behind me in the world 
a name that would last for ever i am thankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought 
into effect said the emperor and i shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting 
your loyalty to the test and i therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to be where i am 
and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him my meaning is sancho 
that the desire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive what thinkest thou was it that 
flung horatius in full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the tiber what burned 
the hand and arm of mutius what impelled curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that 
opened in the midst of rome what in opposition to all the omens that declared against him 
made julius caesar cross the rubicon and to come to more modern examples what scuttled 
the ships and left stranded and cut off the gallant spaniards under the command of the 
most courteous cortes in the new world all these and a variety of other great exploits 
are were and will be the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and a portion of the 
immortality their famous deeds deserve though we catholic christians and knightserrant 
look more to that future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than 
to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this present transitory life a fame that 
however long it may last must after all end with the world itself which has its own appointed 
end so that o sancho in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the christian religion 
we profess has assigned to us we have to slay pride in giants envy by generosity and nobleness 
of heart anger by calmness of demeanour and equanimity gluttony and sloth by the spareness 
of our diet and the length of our vigils lust and lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to 
those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts indolence by traversing the world 
in all directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves besides christians famous 
knights such sancho are the means by which we reach those extremes of praise that fair 
fame carries with it all that your worship has said is quite true answered the lad but the 
end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship supposes how the 
opposite said don quixote did not the clown pay thee then not only did he not pay me replied 
the lad but as soon as your worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone he tied me 
up again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging that left me like a flayed saint bartholomew 
and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some jest or gibe about having made a fool 
of your worship and but for the pain i was suffering i should have laughed at the things 
he said in short he left me in such a condition that i have been until now in a hospital getting 
cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on me then for all which your 
worship is to blame for if you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for 
you nor meddled in other peoples affairs my master would have been content with giving 
me one or two dozen lashes and would have then loosed me and paid me what he owed me but when 
your worship abused him so out of measure and gave him so many hard words his anger was kindled 
and as he could not revenge himself on you as soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst 
upon me in such a way that i shall remain injured for ever and the height of misadventure 
it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures things do not all happen in the same 
way answered don quixote it all came sir bachelor alonzo lopez of your going as you did 
by night dressed in those surplices with lighted torches praying covered with mourning 
so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the other world and so i could not 
avoid doing my duty in attacking you and i should have attacked you even had i known positively 
that you were the very devils of hell for such i certainly believed and took you to be as 
my fate has so willed it said the bachelor i entreat you sir knighterrant whose errand 
has been such an evil one for me to help me to get from under this mule that holds one of my 
legs caught between the stirrup and the saddle i would have talked on till tomorrow said 
don quixote how long were you going to wait before telling me of your distress he at once 
called to sancho who however had no mind to come as he was just then engaged in unloading 
a sumpter mule well laden with provender which these worthy gentlemen had brought with 
them sancho made a bag of his coat and getting together as much as he could and as the bag 
would hold he loaded his beast and then hastened to obey his masters call and helped him 
to remove the bachelor from under the mule then putting him on her back he gave him the torch 
and don quixote bade him follow the track of his companions and beg pardon of them on his 
part for the wrong which he could not help doing them and said sancho if by chance these 
gentlemen should want to know who was the hero that served them so your worship may tell 
them that he is the famous don quixote of la mancha who rights wrongs gives food to those 
who thirst and drink to the hungry thats all very well but do you know her house sancho my 
master says it will be some royal palace or grand castle and have you ever seen her by any 
chance neither i nor my master ever saw her and does it strike you that it would be just and 
right if the el toboso people finding out that you were here with the intention of going 
to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies were to come and cudgel your 
ribs and not leave a whole bone in you they would indeed have very good reason if they did 
not see that i am under orders and that you are a messenger my friend no blame belongs to 
you dont you trust to that sancho for the manchegan folk are as hottempered as they are 
honest and wont put up with liberties from anybody by the lord if they get scent of you it 
will be worse for you i promise you be off you scoundrel let the bolt fall why should i go 
looking for three feet on a cat to please another man and what is more when looking for dulcinea 
will be looking for marica in ravena or the bachelor in salamanca the devil the devil and 
nobody else has mixed me up in this business such was the soliloquy sancho held with himself 
and all the conclusion he could come to was to say to himself again well theres remedy for 
everything except death under whose yoke we have all to pass whether we like it or not that 
the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his strong arm and then what shall 
we say of gasabal the squire of galaor who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the 
greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the whole 
of that history as long as it is truthful from all i have said thou wilt gather sancho that 
there must be a difference between master and man between lord and lackey between knight 
and squire so that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more respect 
and take less liberties for in whatever way i may be provoked with you it will be bad for 
the pitcher the favours and benefits that i have promised you will come in due time and 
if they do not your wages at least will not be lost as i have already told you all that your 
worship says is very well said sancho but i should like to know in case the time of favours 
should not come and it might be necessary to fall back upon wages how much did the squire 
of a knighterrant get in those days and did they agree by the month or by the day like bricklayers 
i do not believe replied don quixote that such squires were ever on wages but were dependent 
on favour and if i have now mentioned thine in the sealed will i have left at home it was with 
a view to what may happen for as yet i know not how chivalry will turn out in these wretched 
times of ours and i do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles in the other world for i would 
have thee know sancho that the valour which is not based upon a foundation of prudence 
is called rashness and the exploits of the rash man are to be attributed rather to good 
fortune than to courage and so i own that i retired but not that i fled and therein i have 
followed the example of many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times 
the histories are full of instances of this but as it would not be any good to thee or pleasure 
to me i will not recount them to thee now sancho was by this time mounted with the help of 
don quixote who then himself mounted rocinante and at a leisurely pace they proceeded 
to take shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off every now and 
then sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans and on don quixote asking him what 
caused such acute suffering he replied that from the end of his backbone up to the nape 
of his neck he was so sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses the cause of that soreness 
said don quixote will be no doubt that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very 
long one it caught thee all down the back where all the parts that are sore are situated 
and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still by god said sancho your worship 
has relieved me of a great doubt and cleared up the point for me in elegant style body o me 
is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that theres any need to tell me i am sore everywhere 
the staff hit me if it was my ankles that pained me there might be something in going divining 
why they did but it is not much to divine that im sore where they thrashed me by my faith master 
mine the ills of others hang by a hair every day i am discovering more and more how little 
i have to hope for from keeping company with your worship for if this time you have allowed 
me to be drubbed the next time or a hundred times more well have the blanketings of the other 
day over again and all the other pranks which if they have fallen on my shoulders now will 
be thrown in my teeth byandby i would do a great deal better if i was not an ignorant brute 
that will never do any good all my life i would do a great deal better i say to go home to my 
wife and children and support them and bring them up on what god may please to give me instead 
of following your worship along roads that lead nowhere and paths that are none at all 
with little to drink and less to eat and then when it comes to sleeping measure out seven 
feet on the earth brother squire and if thats not enough for you take as many more for you 
may have it all your own way and stretch yourself to your hearts content oh that i could 
see burnt and turned to ashes the first man that meddled with knighterrantry or at any 
rate the first who chose to be squire to such fools as all the knightserrant of past times 
must have been of those of the present day i say nothing because as your worship is one of 
them i respect them and because i know your worship knows a point more than the devil in 
all you say and think i would lay a good wager that where they say in italian piace you say 
in spanish place and where they say piu you say mas and you translate su by arriba and giu 
by abajo i translate them so of course said the author for those are their proper equivalents 
i would venture to swear said don quixote that your worship is not known in the world which 
always begrudges their reward to rare wits and praiseworthy labours what talents lie 
wasted there what genius thrust away into corners what worth left neglected still it 
seems to me that translation from one language into another if it be not from the queens 
of languages the greek and the latin is like looking at flemish tapestries on the wrong 
side for though the figures are visible they are full of threads that make them indistinct 
and they do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side and translation 
from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of words any more than transcribing 
or copying out one document from another but i do not mean by this to draw the inference 
that no credit is to be allowed for the work of translating for a man may employ himself 
in ways worse and less profitable to himself this estimate does not include two famous 
translators doctor cristobal de figueroa in his pastor fido and don juan de jauregui 
in his aminta wherein by their felicity they leave it in doubt which is the translation 
and which the original but tell me are you printing this book at your own risk or have you 
sold the copyright to some bookseller i print at my own risk said the author and i expect 
to make a thousand ducats at least by this first edition which is to be of two thousand copies 
that will go off in a twinkling at six reals apiece a fine calculation you are making said 
don quixote it is plain you dont know the ins and outs of the printers and how they play into 
one anothers hands i promise you when you find yourself saddled with two thousand copies 
you will feel so sore that it will astonish you particularly if the book is a little out 
of the common and not in any way highly spiced what said the author would your worship then 
have me give it to a bookseller who will give three maravedis for the copyright and think 
he is doing me a favour i do not print my books to win fame in the world for i am known in it already 
by my works i want to make money without which reputation is not worth a rap god send your 
worship good luck said don quixote and he moved on to another case where he saw them correcting 
a sheet of a book with the title of light of the soul noticing it he observed books like this 
though there are many of the kind are the ones that deserve to be printed for many are the 
sinners in these days and lights unnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness he 
passed on and saw they were also correcting another book and when he asked its title they 
told him it was called the second part of the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha 
in shelter of your excellencys glamorous name to whom with the obeisance i owe to such 
grandeur i pray to receive it agreeably under his protection so that in this shadow though 
deprived of that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe the works composed 
in the houses of those who know it dares appear with assurance in the judgment of some who 
trespassing the bounds of their own ignorance use to condemn with more rigour and less 
justice the writings of others it is my earnest hope that your excellencys good counsel 
in regard to my honourable purpose will not disdain the littleness of so humble a service 
miguel de cervantes volume i chapter i which treats of the character and pursuits of the 
famous gentleman don quixote of la mancha in shelter of your excellencys glamorous name 
to whom with the obeisance i owe to such grandeur i pray to receive it agreeably under his 
protection so that in this shadow though deprived of that precious ornament of elegance 
and erudition that clothe the works composed in the houses of those who know it dares appear 
with assurance in the judgment of some who trespassing the bounds of their own ignorance 
use to condemn with more rigour and less justice the writings of others it is my earnest 
hope that your excellencys good counsel in regard to my honourable purpose will not disdain 
the littleness of so humble a service miguel de cervantes volume i chapter i which treats 
of the character and pursuits of the famous gentleman don quixote of la mancha and the 
lacquey tosilos in defence of the daughter of dona rodriguez chapter lvii which treats 
of how don quixote took leave of the duke and of what followed with the witty and impudent 
altisidora one of the duchesss damsels chapter lviii which tells how adventures came 
crowding on don quixote in such numbers that they gave one another no breathingtime chapter 
lix wherein is related the strange thing which may be regarded as an adventure that happened 
don quixote a clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved don quixote 
and sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour of the bulls and by the 
side of this having turned dapple and rocinante loose without headstall or bridle the 
forlorn pair master and man seated themselves sancho had recourse to the larder of his 
alforjas and took out of them what he called the prog don quixote rinsed his mouth and bathed 
his face by which cooling process his flagging energies were revived out of pure vexation 
he remained without eating and out of pure politeness sancho did not venture to touch 
a morsel of what was before him but waited for his master to act as taster seeing however 
that absorbed in thought he was forgetting to carry the bread to his mouth he said never 
a word and trampling every sort of good breeding under foot began to stow away in his paunch 
the bread and cheese that came to his hand eat sancho my friend said don quixote but to enable 
thee to recover strength we must keep it for our own village for at the latest we shall get 
there the day after tomorrow sancho said he might do as he pleased but that for his own part 
he would like to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled and while he had 
an appetite because in delay there is apt to be danger very often and praying to god and 
plying the hammer and one take was better than two ill give thees and a sparrow in the hand 
than a vulture on the wing and he who has the good to his hand and chooses the bad that the 
good he complains of may not come to him look here sancho said don quixote if thou hadst 
not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech well well i forgive thee provided 
thou dost mend and not show thyself in future so fond of thine own interest but try to be 
of good cheer and take heart and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment 
of my promises which by being delayed does not become impossible sancho said he would 
do so and keep up his heart as best he could they then entered the grove and don quixote settled 
himself at the foot of an elm and sancho at that of a beech for trees of this kind and others 
like them always have feet but no hands sancho passed the night in pain for with the evening 
dews the blow of the staff made itself felt all the more don quixote passed it in his neverfailing 
meditations but for all that they had some winks of sleep and with the appearance of daylight 
they pursued their journey in quest of the banks of the famous ebro where that befell them 
which will be told in the following chapter chapter xix of the shrewd discourse which 
sancho held with his master and of the adventure that befell him with a dead body together 
with other notable occurrences it seems to me senor that all these mishaps that have befallen 
us of late have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed by your worship 
against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you made not to eat bread off a tablecloth 
or embrace the queen and all the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you 
had taken that helmet of malandrinos or whatever the moor is called for i do not very well 
remember thou art very right sancho said don quixote but to tell the truth it had escaped 
my memory and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the affair of the blanket happened 
to thee because of thy fault in not reminding me of it in time but i will make amends for there 
are ways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry why have i taken an oath 
of some sort then said sancho it makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath said don 
quixote suffice it that i see thou art not quite clear of complicity and whether or no it 
will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a remedy in that case said sancho mind that 
your worship does not forget this as you did the oath perhaps the phantoms may take it into 
their heads to amuse themselves once more with me or even with your worship if they see 
you so obstinate while engaged in this and other talk night overtook them on the road before 
they had reached or discovered any place of shelter and what made it still worse was that 
they were dying of hunger for with the loss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder 
and commissariat and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without 
any invention had really the appearance of one it so happened that the night closed in 
somewhat darkly but for all that they pushed on sancho feeling sure that as the road was 
the kings highway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two 
going along then in this way the night dark the squire hungry the master sharpset they 
saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling a great number of lights which 
looked exactly like stars in motion sancho was taken aback at the sight of them nor did 
don quixote altogether relish them the one pulled up his ass by the halter the other his 
hack by the bridle and they stood still watching anxiously to see what all this would turn 
out to be and found that the lights were approaching them and the nearer they came the greater 
they seemed at which spectacle sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury and 
don quixotes hair stood on end he however plucking up spirit a little said this no doubt 
sancho will be a most mighty and perilous adventure in which it will be needful for me to 
put forth all my valour and resolution unlucky me answered sancho if this adventure happens 
to be one of phantoms as i am beginning to think it is where shall i find the ribs to bear it 
be they phantoms ever so much said don quixote i will not set foot in saragossa and by that 
means i shall expose to the world the lie of this new history writer and people will see 
that i am not the vanquished don quixote you take me to be with this cutting short the colloquy 
they mounted and don quixote wheeled rocinante round in order to take up the necessary 
distance the viceroy upon this seeing that the pair of them were evidently preparing 
to come to the charge put himself between them asking them what it was that led them to engage 
in combat all of a sudden in this way the knight of the white moon whose unheardof achievements 
will perhaps have recalled him to thy memory i come to do battle with thee and prove the 
might of thy arm to the end that i make thee acknowledge and confess that my lady let her 
be who she may replied don quixote i will do what is my bounden duty and what my conscience 
bids me in conformity with what i have professed and turning to the damsel he said let your 
great beauty rise for i grant the boon which you would ask of me then what i ask said the damsel 
is that your magnanimous person accompany me at once whither i will conduct you and that 
you promise not to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me of a 
traitor who against all human and divine law has usurped my kingdom i repeat that i grant 
it replied don quixote and so lady you may from this day forth lay aside the melancholy 
that distresses you and let your failing hopes gather new life and strength for with the 
help of god and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom and seated 
upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm notwithstanding and despite of the felons 
who would gainsay it and now hands to the work for in delay there is apt to be danger very 
often and praying to god and plying the hammer and that one take is better than two ill give 
thees and i say a womans advice is no great thing and he who wont take it is a fool and so say 
i said don quixote continue sancho my friend go on you talk pearls today the fact is continued 
sancho that as your worship knows better than i do we are all of us liable to death and today 
we are and tomorrow we are not and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep and as i have heard our 
curate say treads with equal foot upon the lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the 
poor that lady is more mighty than dainty she is no way squeamish she devours all and is 
ready for all and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts ages and ranks she is no reaper 
that sleeps out the noontide at all times she is reaping and cutting down as well the dry 
grass as the green she never seems to chew but bolts and swallows all that is put before 
her for she has a canine appetite that is never satisfied and though she has no belly she 
shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of all that live as one would drink 
a jug of cold water say no more sancho said don quixote at this dont try to better it and risk 
a fall for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy rustic phrase is what a good preacher 
might have said i tell thee sancho if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit thou 
mightst take a pulpit in hand and go about the world preaching fine sermons he preaches 
well who lives well said sancho and i know no more theology than that nor needst thou said 
don quixote but i cannot make out what thou art driving at what i am driving at said sancho 
is that your worship settle some fixed wages for me to be paid monthly while i am in your 
service and that the same he paid me out of your estate for i dont care to stand on rewards 
which either come late or ill or never at all god help me with my own in short i would like 
to know what i am to get be it much or little for the hen will lay on one egg and many littles 
make a much and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost to be sure if it should 
happen what i neither believe nor expect that your worship were to give me that island 
you have promised me i am not so ungrateful nor so grasping but that i would be willing to 
have the revenue of such island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion sancho 
my friend replied don quixote sometimes proportion may be as good as promotion i see said 
sancho ill bet i ought to have said proportion and not promotion but it is no matter as your 
worship has understood me and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen 
into the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless 
shafts of thy proverbs look here sancho i would readily fix thy wages if i had ever found 
any instance in the histories of the knightserrant to show or indicate by the slightest 
hint what their squires used to get monthly or yearly but i have read all or the best part 
of their histories and i cannot remember reading of any knighterrant having assigned 
fixed wages to his squire i only know that they all served on reward and that when they least 
expected it if good luck attended their masters they found themselves recompensed with 
an island or something equivalent to it or at the least they were left with a title and lordship 
if with these hopes and additional inducements you sancho please to return to my service 
well and good but to suppose that i am going to travel on foot and make long ones is to suppose 
nonsense thou sayest well sancho said don quixote let my armour be hung up for a trophy 
and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what was inscribed on the trophy of rolands 
armour these let none move who dareth not his might with roland prove thats the very thing 
said sancho and if it was not that we should feel the want of rocinante on the road it would 
be as well to see first of all what clavileno has in his stomach there is no occasion said 
the distressed one i will be bail for him and i know that malambruno has nothing tricky 
or treacherous about him you may mount without any fear senor don quixote on my head be 
it if it is wrong besides which you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merely 
hearing a bray i remember when i was a boy i brayed as often as i had a fancy without anyone 
hindering me and so elegantly and naturally that when i brayed all the asses in the town 
would bray but i was none the less for that the son of my parents who were greatly respected 
and though i was envied because of the gift by more than one of the high and mighty ones of 
the town i did not care two farthings for it and that you may see i am telling the truth wait 
a bit and listen for this art like swimming once learnt is never forgotten and then taking 
hold of his nose he began to bray so vigorously that all the valleys around rang again one 
of those however that stood near him fancying he was mocking them lifted up a long staff 
he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with it that sancho dropped helpless to the ground 
don quixote seeing him so roughly handled attacked the man who had struck him lance in 
hand but so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him far from it 
finding a shower of stones rained upon him and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled 
at him he wheeled rocinante round and as fast as his best gallop could take him fled from 
the midst of them commending himself to god with all his heart to deliver him out of this 
peril in dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming out at his breast 
and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it had gone from him the members of the 
band however were satisfied with seeing him take to flight and did not fire on him they 
put up sancho scarcely restored to his senses on his ass and let him go after his master 
not that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast but dapple followed the footsteps 
of rocinante from whom he could not remain a moment separated don quixote having got some 
way off looked back and seeing sancho coming waited for him as he perceived that no one 
followed him the men of the troop stood their ground till night and as the enemy did not 
come out to battle they returned to their town exulting and had they been aware of the ancient 
custom of the greeks they would have erected a trophy on the spot chapter xxviii of matters 
that benengeli says he who reads them will know if he reads them with attention when the 
brave man flees treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to reserve themselves for 
better occasions this proved to be the case with don quixote who giving way before the 
fury of the townsfolk and the hostile intentions of the angry troop took to flight and 
without a thought of sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him retreated to such 
a distance as he thought made him safe sancho lying across his ass followed him as has been 
said and at length came up having by this time recovered his senses and on joining him let 
himself drop off dapple at rocinantes feet sore bruised and belaboured don quixote dismounted 
to examine his wounds but finding him whole from head to foot he said to him angrily enough 
in an evil hour didst thou take to braying sancho where hast thou learned that it is well 
done to mention the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged to the music of brays 
what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels give thanks to god sancho that they 
signed the cross on thee just now with a stick and did not mark thee per signum crucis with 
a cutlass im not equal to answering said sancho for i feel as if i was speaking through my 
shoulders let us mount and get away from this ill keep from braying but not from saying 
that knightserrant fly and leave their good squires to be pounded like privet or made 
meal of at the hands of their enemies he does not fly who retires returned don quixote for 
i would have thee know sancho if thou knowest it not that with lovers the outward actions 
and motions they give way to when their loves are in question are the faithful messengers 
that carry the news of what is going on in the depths of their hearts go my friend may better 
fortune than mine attend thee and bring thee a happier issue than that which i await in 
dread in this dreary solitude i will go and return quickly said sancho cheer up that little 
heart of yours master mine for at the present moment you seem to have got one no bigger than 
a hazel nut remember what they say that a stout heart breaks bad luck as you very well know 
to this sancho replied with an irrelevant remark which addressing merlin he made to him 
will your worship tell me senor merlinwhen that courier devil came up he gave my master 
a message from senor montesinos charging him to wait for him here as he was coming to arrange 
how the lady dona dulcinea del toboso was to be disenchanted but up to the present we have 
not seen montesinos nor anything like him to which merlin made answer the devil sancho 
is a blockhead and a great scoundrel i sent him to look for your master but not with a message 
from montesinos but from myself for montesinos is in his cave expecting or more properly 
speaking waiting for his disenchantment for theres the tail to be skinned yet for him 
if he owes you anything or you have any business to transact with him ill bring him to you 
and put him where you choose but for the present make up your mind to consent to this penance 
and believe me it will be very good for you for soul as well for bodyfor your soul because 
of the charity with which you perform it for your body because i know that you are of a sanguine 
habit and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood there are a great many doctors in the 
world even the enchanters are doctors said sancho however as everybody tells me the same 
thingthough i cant see it myselfi say i am willing to give myself the three thousand three 
hundred lashes provided i am to lay them on whenever i like without any fixing of days or 
times and ill try and get out of debt as quickly as i can that the world may enjoy the beauty 
of the lady dulcinea where is this poor giant or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight 
to find her i think i can see them wandering all over el toboso looking like noddies and 
asking for my lady dulcinea and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they wont 
know her any more than they would my father perhaps sancho returned don quixote the enchantment 
does not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from thee against me alone 
and against my eyes is the strength of its venom directed nevertheless there is one thing 
which has occurred to me and that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me for as 
well as i recollect dulcinea can neither read nor write nor in the whole course of her life 
has she seen handwriting or letter of mine for my love and hers have been always platonic 
not going beyond a modest look and even that so seldom that i can safely swear i have not 
seen her four times in all these twelve years i have been loving her more than the light 
of these eyes that the earth will one day devour and perhaps even of those four times she 
has not once perceived that i was looking at her such is the retirement and seclusion in 
which her father lorenzo corchuelo and her mother aldonza nogales have brought her up 
so so said sancho lorenzo corchuelos daughter is the lady dulcinea del toboso otherwise 
called aldonza lorenzo she it is said don quixote and she it is that is worthy to be lady 
of the whole universe i know her well said sancho and let me tell you she can fling a crowbar 
as well as the lustiest lad in all the town giver of all good but she is a brave lass and a right 
and stout one and fit to be helpmate to any knighterrant that is or is to be who may make her 
his lady the whoreson wench what sting she has and what a voice i can tell you one day she 
posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to call some labourers of theirs 
that were in a ploughed field of her fathers and though they were better than half a league 
off they heard her as well as if they were his own sancho saw him and recognised him and the 
instant he did so he shouted to him ginesillo you thief give up my treasure release my life 
embarrass thyself not with my repose quit my ass leave my delight be off rip get thee gone 
thief and give up what is not thine there was no necessity for so many words or objurgations 
for at the first one gines jumped down and at a like racing speed made off and got clear of 
them all sancho hastened to his dapple and embracing him he said how hast thou fared my 
blessing dapple of my eyes my comrade all the while kissing him and caressing him as if 
he were a human being the ass held his peace and let himself be kissed and caressed by sancho 
without answering a single word they all came up and congratulated him on having found 
dapple don quixote especially who told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel 
the order for the three asscolts on the other side and sign it very plainly that they may 
recognise it at first sight with all my heart said don quixote and reading it aloud as sancho 
had requested him he found it ran thus thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me 
to a place whence the news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint 
ungrateful one thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy but not more worthy but if virtue 
were esteemed wealth i should neither envy the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes 
of my own what thy beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low by it i believed thee to be an angel 
by them i know thou art a woman peace be with thee who hast sent war to me and heaven grant 
that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from thee so that thou repent not of what thou 
hast done and i reap not a revenge i would not have when he had finished the letter don quixote 
said there is less to be gathered from this than from the verses except that he who wrote 
it is some rejected lover and turning over nearly all the pages of the book he found more 
verses and letters some of which he could read while others he could not but they were all 
made up of complaints laments misgivings desires and aversions favours and rejections 
some rapturous some doleful while don quixote examined the book sancho examined the 
valise not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he did not search peer into 
and explore or seam that he did not rip or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces lest 
anything should escape for want of care and pains so keen was the covetousness excited 
in him by the discovery of the crowns which amounted to near a hundred and though he found 
no more booty he held the blanket flights balsam vomits stake benedictions carriers 
fisticuffs missing alforjas stolen coat and all the hunger thirst and weariness he had 
endured in the service of his good master cheap at the price as he considered himself more 
than fully indemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the treasuretrove 
the knight of the rueful countenance would have worn such an altered countenance that 
the mother that bore him would not have known him lean yellow with his eyes sunk deep in 
the cells of his skull so that to bring him round again ever so little cost me more than six 
hundred eggs as god knows and all the world and my hens too that wont let me tell a lie that 
i can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good and so fat and so wellbred that 
they would not say one thing for another though they were to burst for it in short then mistress 
housekeeper that is all and there is nothing the matter except what it is feared don quixote 
may do no senor said she well then returned the bachelor dont be uneasy but go home in peace 
get me ready something hot for breakfast and while you are on the way say the prayer of santa 
apollonia that is if you know it for i will come presently and you will see miracles woe 
is me cried the housekeeper is it the prayer of santa apollonia you would have me say that 
would do if it was the toothache my master had but it is in the brains what he has got i know 
what i am saying mistress housekeeper go and dont set yourself to argue with me for you 
know i am a bachelor of salamanca and one cant be more of a bachelor than that replied carrasco 
and with this the housekeeper retired and the bachelor went to look for the curate and 
arrange with him what will be told in its proper place while don quixote and sancho were 
shut up together they had a discussion which the history records with great precision 
and scrupulous exactness sancho said to his master senor would your worship give me leave 
to speak a little to you for since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several 
things have gone to rot in my stomach and i have now just one on the tip of my tongue for all 
that sancho said don quixote take heed of what thou sayest for the pitcher goes so often 
to the welli need say no more to thee well well said sancho god is in heaven and sees all tricks 
and will judge who does most harm i in not speaking right or your worship in not doing it 
that is enough said dorothea run sancho and kiss your lords hand and beg his pardon and 
henceforward be more circumspect with your praise and abuse and say nothing in disparagement 
of that lady toboso of whom i know nothing save that i am her servant and put your trust in 
god for you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince sancho advanced 
hanging his head and begged his masters hand which don quixote with dignity presented 
to him giving him his blessing as soon as he had kissed it he then bade him go on ahead a little 
as he had questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him sancho 
obeyed and when the two had gone some distance in advance don quixote said to him since 
thy return i have had no opportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy 
mission and the answer thou hast brought back and now that chance has granted us the time 
and opportunity deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good news let your 
worship ask what you will answered sancho for i shall find a way out of all as as i found a 
way in but i implore you senor not not to be so revengeful in future why dost thou say that 
sancho said don quixote i say it he returned because those blows just now were more because 
of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other night than for what i said 
against my lady dulcinea whom i love and reverence as i would a relicthough there is nothing 
of that about hermerely as something belonging to your worship say no more on that subject 
for thy life sancho said don quixote for it is displeasing to me i have already pardoned 
thee for that and thou knowest the common saying for a fresh sin a fresh penance while this 
was going on they saw coming along the road they were travelling and persuaded that this 
must be some new adventure he called aloud to sancho to come and bring him his helmet sancho 
hearing himself called quitted the shepherds and prodding dapple vigorously came up 
to his master to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure chapter xvii wherein 
is shown the furthest and highest point which the unexampled courage of don quixote reached 
or could reach together with the happily achieved adventure of the lions chapter xviii 
of what happened don quixote in the castle or house of the knight of the green gaban together 
with other matters out of the common don quixote found don diego de mirandas house built 
in village style with his arms in rough stone over the street door in the patio was the storeroom 
and at the entrance the cellar with plenty of winejars standing round which coming from 
el toboso brought back to his memory his enchanted and transformed dulcinea and with 
a sigh and not thinking of what he was saying or in whose presence he was he exclaimed o ye 
sweet treasures to my sorrow found once sweet and welcome when twas heavens goodwill 
o ye tobosan jars how ye bring back to my memory the sweet object of my bitter regrets the 
student poet don diegos son who had come out with his mother to receive him heard this exclamation 
and both mother and son were filled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented 
he however dismounting from rocinante advanced with great politeness to ask permission 
to kiss the ladys hand while don diego said senora pray receive with your wonted kindness 
senor don quixote of la mancha said the duke where my lady dona dulcinea del toboso i never 
heard my lady dulcinea called dona observed sancho here nothing more than the lady dulcinea 
del toboso so here already the history is wrong that is not an objection of any importance 
replied carrasco certainly not said don quixote but tell me what jewel was it that she 
gave thee on taking thy leave in return for thy tidings of me for it is a usual and ancient 
custom with knights and ladies errant to give the squires damsels or dwarfs who bring 
tidings of their ladies to the knights or of their knights to the ladies some rich jewel 
as a guerdon for good news and acknowledgment of the message that is very likely said sancho 
and a good custom it was to my mind but that must have been in days gone by for now it would 
seem to be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese because that was what my lady 
dulcinea gave me over the top of the yardwall when i took leave of her and more by token it 
was sheepsmilk cheese she is generous in the extreme said don quixote and if she did not 
give thee a jewel of gold no doubt it must have been because she had not one to hand there 
to give thee but sleeves are good after easter i shall see her and all shall be made right 
but knowest thou what amazes me sancho it seems to me thou must have gone and come through 
the air for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to el toboso and return 
and things turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount dapple he spied coming 
from el toboso towards the spot where he stood three peasant girls on three colts or filliesfor 
the author does not make the point clear though it is more likely they were sheasses the 
usual mount with village girls but as it is of no great consequence we need not stop to prove 
it to be brief the instant sancho saw the peasant girls he returned full speed to seek his 
master and found him sighing and uttering a thousand passionate lamentations when don 
quixote saw him he exclaimed what news sancho my friend am i to mark this day with a white 
stone as one of the happiest i can expect to enjoy in my lifetime since i have seen senor 
don quixote of la mancha says observed the curate is the truth for he goes enchanted in 
this cart not from any fault or sins of his but because of the malevolence of those to whom 
virtue is odious and valour hateful this senor is the knight of the rueful countenance 
by the life of my father said sancho when he heard the letter it is the loftiest thing i ever 
heard body of me how your worship says everything as you like in it and how well you fit in 
the knight of the rueful countenance if my departure and your worships madness are to 
come off in earnest it will be as well to saddle rocinante again in order that he may supply 
the want of dapple because it will save me time in going and returning for if i go on foot 
i dont know when i shall get there or when i shall get back as i am in truth a bad walker i declare 
sancho returned don quixote it shall be as thou wilt for thy plan does not seem to me a bad 
one and i feel an inclination to read it all to which the landlord replied then your reverence 
will do well to read it for i can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been 
much pleased with it and have begged it of me very earnestly but i would not give it meaning 
to return it to the person who forgot the valise books and papers here for maybe he will 
return here some time or other and though i know i shall miss the books faith i mean to return 
them for though i am an innkeeper still i am a christian you are very right friend said the 
curate but for all that if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it with all my heart replied 
the host while they were talking cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read it and 
forming the same opinion of it as the curate he begged him to read it so that they might all 
hear it i would read it said the curate if the time would not be better spent in sleeping 
it will be rest enough for me said dorothea to while away the time by listening to some tale 
for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable well 
then in that case said the curate we must pass right through my village and there your worship 
will take the road to cartagena where you will be able to receive her blessing unless indeed 
she throws it over the wall of the yard so be it said another and while two of them went in 
one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn observing all which the 
landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions 
though he understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had given 
him it was by this time broad daylight and for that reason as well as in consequence of the 
noise don quixote had made everybody was awake and up but particularly dona clara and 
dorothea for they had been able to sleep but badly that night the one from agitation at 
having her lover so near her the other from curiosity to see him don quixote when he saw 
sanchos flight without wings asked the general if this was a usual ceremony with those 
who came on board the galleys for the first time for if so as he had no intention of adopting 
them as a profession he had no mind to perform such feats of agility and if anyone offered 
to lay hold of him to whirl him about he vowed to god he would kick his soul out and as he said 
this he stood up and clapped his hand upon his sword at this instant they struck the awning 
and lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle sancho thought heaven was coming off its 
hinges and going to fall on his head and full of terror he ducked it and buried it between 
his knees nor were don quixotes knees altogether under control for he too shook a little 
squeezed his shoulders together and lost colour the crew then hoisted the yard with the 
same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it all the while keeping silence as though 
they had neither voice nor breath the boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor and leaping 
upon the middle of the gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash 
or whip and to haul out gradually to sea when sancho saw so many red feet for such he took 
the oars to be moving all together he said to himself its these that are the real chanted 
things and not the ones my master talks of what can those wretches have done to be so whipped 
and how does that one man who goes along there whistling dare to whip so many i declare this 
is hell or at least purgatory don quixote observing how attentively sancho regarded 
what was going on said to him ah sancho my friend how quickly and cheaply might you finish 
off the disenchantment of dulcinea if you would strip to the waist and take your place 
among those gentlemen amid the pain and sufferings of so many you would not feel your own 
much and moreover perhaps the sage merlin would allow each of these lashes being laid 
on with a good hand to count for ten of those which you must give yourself at last the general 
was about to ask what these lashes were and what was dulcineas disenchantment when a sailor 
exclaimed monjui signals that there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west on hearing 
this the general sprang upon the gangway crying now then my sons dont let her give us the 
slip it must be some algerine corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us the 
three others immediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders the 
general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other kept in shore so that in this 
way the vessel could not escape them the crews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously 
that they seemed to fly the two that had put out to sea after a couple of miles sighted a vessel 
which so far as they could make out they judged to be one of fourteen or fifteen banks and 
so she proved as soon as the vessel discovered the galleys she went about with the object 
and in the hope of making her escape by her speed but the attempt failed for the chief galley 
was one of the fastest vessels afloat and overhauled her so rapidly that they on board 
the brigantine saw clearly there was no possibility of escaping and the rais therefore 
would have had them drop their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain 
in command of our galleys to anger but chance directing things otherwise so ordered it 
that just as the chief galley came close enough for those on board the vessel to hear the 
shouts from her calling on them to surrender two toraquis that is to say two turks both 
drunken that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine discharged their muskets 
killing two of the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel seeing this the general 
swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vessel alive but as he bore down 
furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars the galley shot a good 
way ahead those on board the vessel saw their case was desperate and while the galley was 
coming about they made sail and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off but their 
activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm for the galley coming 
up with them in a little more than half a league they perceived some dozen men dressed like 
labourers stretched upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner 
they had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some objects under them 
standing upright or lying flat and arranged at intervals don quixote approached the 
diners and saluting them courteously first he asked them what it was those cloths covered 
senor answered one of the party under these cloths are some images carved in relief intended 
for a retablo we are putting up in our village we carry them covered up that they may not 
be soiled and on our shoulders that they may not be broken with your good leave said don 
quixote i should like to know from each of them separately the reason of his misfortune 
to this he added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly 
that the other mounted guard said to him though we have here the register and certificate 
of the sentence of every one of these wretches this is no time to take them out or read them 
come and ask themselves they can tell if they choose and they will for these fellows take 
a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities with this permission which don quixote 
would have taken even had they not granted it he approached the chain and asked the first 
for what offences he was now in such a sorry case he made answer that it was for being a lover 
for that only replied don quixote why if for being lovers they send people to the galleys 
i might have been rowing in them long ago the love is not the sort your worship is thinking 
of said the galley slave mine was that i loved a washerwomans basket of clean linen so well 
and held it so close in my embrace that if the arm of the law had not forced it from me i should 
never have let it go of my own will to this moment i was caught in the act there was no occasion 
for torture the case was settled they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back and three 
years of gurapas besides and that was the end of it what are gurapas asked don quixote gurapas 
are galleys answered the galley slave who was a young man of about fourandtwenty and said 
he was a native of piedrahita don quixote asked the same question of the second who made 
no reply so downcast and melancholy was he but the first answered for him and said he sir 
goes as a canary i mean as a musician and a singer what said don quixote for being musicians 
and singers are people sent to the galleys too yes sir answered the galley slave for there 
is nothing worse than singing under suffering on the contrary i have heard say said don 
quixote that he who sings scares away his woes here it is the reverse said the galley slave 
for he who sings once weeps all his life i do not understand it said don quixote but one of 
the guards said to him sir to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity 
to confess under torture they put this sinner to the torture and he confessed his crime 
which was being a cuatrero that is a cattlestealer and on his confession they sentenced 
him to six years in the galleys besides two bundred lashes that he has already had on the 
back and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behind 
and that march here illtreat and snub and jeer and despise him for confessing and not having 
spirit enough to say nay for say they nay has no more letters in it than yea and a culprit 
is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not on that of witnesses 
or evidence and to my thinking they are not very far out and i think so too answered don quixote 
then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked the others and the man answered 
very readily and unconcernedly i am going for five years to their ladyships the gurapas 
for the want of ten ducats i will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble 
said don quixote that said the galley slave is like a man having money at sea when he is dying 
of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants i say so because if at the right time i had 
had those twenty ducats that your worship now offers me i would have greased the notarys 
pen and freshened up the attorneys wit with them so that today i should be in the middle 
of the plaza of the zocodover at toledo and not on this road coupled like a greyhound but 
god is great patiencethere thats enough of it don quixote passed on to the fourth a man 
of venerable aspect with a white beard falling below his breast who on hearing himself 
asked the reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word but the fifth 
acted as his tongue and said this worthy man is going to the galleys for four years after 
having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback that means said sancho panza as i take 
it to have been exposed to shame in public just so replied the galley slave and the offence 
for which they gave him that punishment was having been an earbroker nay bodybroker i 
mean in short that this gentleman goes as a pimp and for having besides a certain touch 
of the sorcerer about him if that touch had not been thrown in said don quixote he would 
not deserve for mere pimping to row in the galleys but rather to command and be admiral 
of them for the office of pimp is no ordinary one being the office of persons of discretion 
one very necessary in a wellordered state and only to be exercised by persons of good birth 
nay there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them as in other offices and recognised 
number as with the brokers on change in this way many of the evils would be avoided which 
are caused by this office and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people 
such as women more or less silly and pages and jesters of little standing and experience 
who on the most urgent occasions and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed let the crumbs 
freeze on the way to their mouths and know not which is their right hand i should like to 
go farther and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those who are to hold 
so necessary an office in the state but this is not the fit place for it some day i will expound 
the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it all i say now is that the additional fact 
of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this 
venerable countenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp though i 
know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simple 
folk fancy for our will is free nor is there herb or charm that can force it all that certain 
silly women and quacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons pretending that they 
have power to cause love for as i say it is an impossibility to compel the will it is true 
said the good old man and indeed sir as far as the charge of sorcery goes i was not guilty 
as to that of being a pimp i cannot deny it but i never thought i was doing any harm by it for 
my only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace and quiet without 
any interference from thee so long as heaven permits them and in so doing thou wilt prove 
the generosity of thy lofty noble spirit and the world shall see that with thee reason 
has more influence than passion all the time dorothea was speaking cardenio though he 
held luscinda in his arms never took his eyes off don fernando determined if he saw him 
make any hostile movement to try and defend himself and resist as best he could all who 
might assail him though it should cost him his life but now don fernandos friends as well 
as the curate and the barber who had been listening to all attentively and in silence on 
his part some kindly words also and with no less goodwill than the curate offered his services 
in any way that might be of use to them he also explained to them in a few words the object 
that had brought them there and the strange nature of don quixotes madness and how they 
were waiting for his squire who had gone in search of him like the recollection of a dream 
the quarrel he had had with don quixote came back to cardenios memory and he described 
it to the others but he was unable to say what the dispute was about at this moment they heard 
a shout and recognised it as coming from sancho panza who not finding them where he had 
left them was calling aloud to them they went to meet him and in answer to their inquiries 
about don quixote he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt lank yellow half 
dead with hunger and sighing for his lady dulcinea and although he had told him that she 
commanded him to quit that place and come to el toboso where she was expecting him he had 
answered that he was determined not to confess unless quiteria first gave him her hand 
in marriage for that happiness would compose his mind and give him courage to make his 
confession don quixote hearing the wounded mans entreaty exclaimed aloud that what 
basilio asked was just and reasonable and moreover a request that might be easily complied 
with and that it would be as much to senor camachos honour to receive the lady quiteria 
as the widow of the brave basilio as if he received her direct from her father in this case 
said he it will be only to say yes and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word 
for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave camacho was listening to all this 
perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do but so urgent were the entreaties 
of basilios friends imploring him to allow quiteria to give him her hand so that his soul 
quitting this life in despair should not be lost that they moved nay forced him to say that 
if quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied as it was only putting off the fulfillment 
of his wishes for a moment at once all assailed quiteria and pressed her some with prayers 
and others with tears and others with persuasive arguments to give her hand to poor basilio 
but she harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue seemed unable or unwilling 
to utter a word nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly 
what she meant to do as basilio now had his soul at his teeth and there was no time for hesitation 
on this the fair quiteria to all appearance distressed grieved and repentant advanced 
without a word to where basilio lay his eyes already turned in his head his breathing short 
and painful murmuring the name of quiteria between his teeth and apparently about to 
die like a heathen and not like a christian quiteria approached him and kneeling demanded 
his hand by signs without speaking basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her said 
o quiteria why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve 
as a dagger to rob me of life for i have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness 
thou givest me in accepting me as thine or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing 
the dread shadow of death over my eyes what i entreat of thee o thou fatal star to me is that 
the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me be not given out of complaisance or to 
deceive me afresh but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon 
thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband for it is not meet that thou shouldst 
trifle with me at such a moment as this or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt 
so truly by thee while uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders 
expected each return of faintness would take his life with it then quiteria overcome 
with modesty and shame holding in her right hand the hand of basilio said no force would 
bend my will as freely therefore as it is possible for me to do so i give thee the hand of a 
lawful wife and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will untroubled and 
unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee yes i give it said basilio 
not agitated or distracted but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant 
me thus do i give myself to be thy wife said quiteria whether thou livest many years or they 
carry thee from my arms to the grave for one so badly wounded observed sancho at this point 
this young man has a great deal to say they should make him leave off billing and cooing 
and attend to his soul for to my thinking he has it more on his tongue than at his teeth basilio 
and quiteria having thus joined hands the priest deeply moved and with tears in his eyes 
pronounced the blessing upon them and implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the 
soul of the newly wedded man who the instant he received the blessing started nimbly to 
his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been sheathed 
in his body all the bystanders were astounded and some more simple than inquiring began 
shouting a miracle a miracle but basilio replied no miracle no miracle only a trick a trick 
the priest perplexed and amazed made haste to examine the wound with both hands and found 
that the blade had passed not through basilios flesh and ribs but through a hollow iron 
tube full of blood which he had adroitly fixed at the place the blood as was afterwards 
ascertained having been so prepared as not to congeal in short the priest and camacho 
and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of the bride showed no signs 
of displeasure at the deception on the contrary hearing them say that the marriage being 
fraudulent would not be valid she said that she confirmed it afresh whence they all concluded 
that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding between the pair whereat 
camacho and his supporters were so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves 
by violence and a great number of them drawing their swords attacked basilio in whose 
protection as many more swords were in an instant unsheathed while don quixote taking 
the lead on horseback with his lance over his arm and well covered with his shield made 
all give way before him sancho who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in such doings 
retreated to the winejars from which he had taken his delectable skimmings considering 
that as a holy place that spot would be respected hold sirs hold cried don quixote in a loud 
voice we have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us remember love 
and war are the same thing and as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and 
stratagems to overcome the enemy so in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and 
devices employed to attain the desired end are justifiable provided they be not to the 
discredit or dishonour of the loved object quiteria belonged to basilio and basilio 
to quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven camacho is rich and can purchase 
his pleasure when where and as it pleases him basilio has but this ewelamb and no one however 
powerful he may be shall take her from him these two whom god hath joined man cannot separate 
and he who attempts it must first pass the point of this lance and so saying he brandished 
it so stoutly and dexterously that he overawed all who did not know him but so deep an impression 
had the rejection of quiteria made on camachos mind that it banished her at once from his 
thoughts and so the counsels of the priest who was a wise and kindly disposed man prevailed 
with him and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised and to 
prove it put up their swords again inveighing against the pliancy of quiteria rather 
than the craftiness of basilio camacho maintaining that if quiteria as a maiden had such 
a love for basilio she would have loved him too as a married woman and that he ought to thank 
heaven more for having taken her than for having given her camacho and those of his following 
therefore being consoled and pacified those on basilios side were appeased and the rich 
camacho to show that he felt no resentment for the trick and did not care about it desired 
the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality neither basilio however nor 
his bride nor their followers would take any part in it and they withdrew to basilios village 
for the poor if they are persons of virtue and good sense have those who follow honour and 
uphold them just as the rich have those who flatter and dance attendance on them with them 
they carried don quixote regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one sancho alone had 
a cloud on his soul for he found himself debarred from waiting for camachos splendid feast 
and festival which lasted until night and thus dragged away he moodily followed his master 
who accompanied basilios party and left behind him the fleshpots of egypt though in his 
heart he took them with him and their now nearly finished skimmings that he carried in 
the bucket conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and abundance of the good cheer 
he was losing and so vexed and dejected though not hungry without dismounting from dapple 
he followed in the footsteps of rocinante chapter xxii wherin is related the grand adventure 
of the cave of montesinos in the heart of la mancha which the valiant don quixote brought 
to a happy termination many and great were the attentions shown to don quixote by the newly 
married couple who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming forward in defence 
of their cause and they exalted his wisdom to the same level with his courage rating him 
as a cid in arms and a cicero in eloquence worthy sancho enjoyed himself for three days 
at the expense of the pair from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme arranged 
with the fair quiteria but a device of basilios who counted on exactly the result they 
had seen he confessed it is true that he had confided his idea to some of his friends so that 
at the proper time they might aid him in his purpose and insure the success of the deception 
that said don quixote is not and ought not to be false if thou dost pride thyself on that 
for want of which thou scornest me witness the pledge which thou didst give me and witness 
heaven which thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me and if all 
this fail thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all 
thy gaiety and vindicate the truth of what i say look at me printed in histories famed in 
arms courteous in behaviour honoured by princes courted by maidens and after all when 
i looked forward to palms triumphs and crowns won and earned by my valiant deeds i have 
this morning seen myself trampled on kicked and crushed by the feet of unclean and filthy 
animals this thought blunts my teeth paralyses my jaws cramps my hands and robs me of all 
appetite for food so much so that i have a mind to let myself die of hunger the cruelest death 
of all deaths so then said sancho munching hard all the time your worship does not agree 
with the proverb that says let martha die but let her die with a full belly i at any rate have 
no mind to kill myself so far from that i mean to do as the cobbler does who stretches the 
leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants ill stretch out my life 
by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it and let me tell you senor theres 
no greater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does take my advice and 
after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green grassmattress and you will see that 
when you awake youll feel something better don quixote did as he recommended for it struck 
him that sanchos reasoning was more like a philosophers than a blockheads and said he 
sancho if thou wilt do for me what i am going to tell now sancho was seated on the captains 
stage close to the aftermost rower on the righthand side he previously instructed in 
what he was to do laid hold of sancho hoisting him up in his arms and the whole crew who were 
standing ready beginning on the right proceeded to pass him on whirling him along from 
hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor 
sanchos eyes and he made quite sure that the devils themselves were flying away with him 
nor did they leave off with him until they had sent him back along the left side and deposited 
him on the poop and the poor fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat and 
unable to comprehend what it was that had happened to him don quixote when he saw that not 
one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his challenge was furious 
and ready to die with indignation and wrath and if he could have found in the ordinances 
of chivalry that it was lawful for a knighterrant to undertake or engage in another enterprise 
when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he had made an 
end of pledging himself i bade him consider well what he was doing and think of the anger 
his father would feel at seeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals i told 
him not to let my beauty such as it was blind him for that was not enough to furnish an excuse 
for his transgression and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me any kindness it would 
be to leave my lot to follow its course at the level my condition required for marriages 
so unequal never brought happiness nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment 
they began with all this that i have now repeated i said to him and much more which i cannot 
recollect but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his purpose he who has no intention 
of paying does not trouble himself about difficulties when he is striking the bargain 
at the same time i argued the matter briefly in my own mind saying to myself i shall not be 
the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station nor will don fernando 
be the first whom beauty or as is more likely a blind attachment has led to mate himself 
below his rank then since i am introducing no new usage or practice i may as well avail myself 
of the honour that chance offers me for even though his inclination for me should not outlast 
the attainment of his wishes i shall be after all his wife before god and if i strive to repel 
him by scorn i can see that fair means failing he is in a mood to use force and i shall be left 
dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those who cannot know how 
innocently i have come to be in this position for what arguments would persuade my parents 
that this gentleman entered my chamber without my consent all these questions and answers 
passed through my mind in a moment but the oaths of don fernando the witnesses he appealed 
to the tears he shed and lastly the charms of his person and his highbred grace which accompanied 
by such signs of genuine love might well have conquered a heart even more free and coy than 
minethese were the things that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares 
to my ruin i called my waitingmaid to me that there might be a witness on earth besides those 
in heaven and again don fernando renewed and repeated his oaths invoked as witnesses 
fresh saints in addition to the former ones called down upon himself a thousand curses 
hereafter should he fail to keep his promise shed more tears redoubled his sighs and pressed 
me closer in his arms from which he had never allowed me to escape and so i was left by my maid 
and ceased to be one and he became a traitor and a perjured man the day which followed the 
night of my misfortune did not come so quickly i imagine as don fernando wished for when 
desire has attained its object the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure 
i say so because don fernando made all haste to leave me and by the adroitness of my maid 
who was indeed the one who had admitted him gained the street before daybreak but on taking 
leave of me he told me though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came that 
i might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his oaths and to confirm 
his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and placed it upon mine he then took his departure 
and i was left i know not whether sorrowful or happy all i can say is i would gladly have told 
it to you more briefly although my fear of wearying you has made me leave out more than one 
circumstance chapter xlii which treats of what further took place in the inn and of several 
other things worth knowing with these words the captive held his peace and don fernando 
said to him in truth captain the manner in which you have related this remarkable adventure 
has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the matter the whole story is 
curious and uncommon and abounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and 
astonishment and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening to it that we should 
be glad if it were to begin again even though tomorrow were to find us still occupied with 
the same tale and while he said this cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service 
to him in any way that lay in their power and in words and language so kindly and sincere 
that the captain was much gratified by their goodwill in particular don fernando offered 
if he would go back with him to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism 
of zoraida and on his own part to provide him with the means of making his appearance in 
his own country with the credit and comfort he was entitled to for all this the captive 
returned thanks very courteously although he would not accept any of their generous 
offers by this time night closed in and as it did there came up to the inn four men on horseback 
well equipped and accoutred with firelocks across their saddlebows they called out 
and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn the cause of which was that two of the guests who 
had passed the night there seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four 
men wanted had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they owed but the landlord 
who minded his own affairs more than other peoples caught them going out of the gate and 
demanded his reckoning abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he 
drove them to reply with their fists and so they began to lay on him in such a style that the 
poor man was forced to cry out and call for help the landlady and her daughter could see 
no one more free to give aid than don quixote and to him the daughter said sir knight by the 
virtue god has given you help my poor father for two wicked men are beating him to a mummy 
to which don quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied fair damsel at the 
present moment your request is inopportune for i am debarred from involving myself in 
any adventure until i have brought to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged 
me but that which i can do for you is what i will now mention run and tell your father to stand 
his ground as well as he can in this battle and on no account to allow himself to be vanquished 
so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted achievements as a knight have earned and 
acquired for him throughout the known world and in confirmation of this i must tell you 
too that it is but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemies transformed the shape 
and person of the fair dulcinea del toboso into a foul and mean village lass and in the same 
way they must have transformed don quixote and if all this does not move or soften that 
hard heart let this thought and reflection move it that you will have hardly quitted this 
spot when from pure fear i shall yield my soul up to anyone that will take it i left home and 
wife and children to come and serve your worship trusting to do better and not worse but 
as covetousness bursts the bag it has rent my hopes asunder for just as i had them highest 
about getting that wretched unlucky island your worship has so often promised me i see 
that instead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach 
for gods sake master mine deal not so unjustly by me and if your worship will not entirely 
give up attempting this feat at least put it off till morning for by what the lore i learned 
when i was a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now because the mouth of 
the horn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm how canst thou see sancho 
said don quixote where it makes that line or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou 
talkest of when the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole heaven 
thats true said sancho but fear has sharp eyes and sees things underground much more above 
in heavens besides there is good reason to show that it now wants but little of day let it 
want what it may replied don quixote it shall not be said of me now or at any time that tears 
or entreaties turned me aside from doing what was in accordance with knightly usage and 
so i beg of thee sancho to undeceive thyself and see that what i say is true mount thy ass 
and follow them quietly and thou shalt see that when they have gone some little distance 
from this they will return to their original shape and ceasing to be sheep become men in 
all respects as i described them to thee at first but go not just yet for i want thy help and 
assistance come hither and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing from this 
right side of the upper jaw for it is there i feel the pain sancho put in his fingers and feeling 
about asked him how many grinders used your worship have on this side four replied don 
quixote besides the backtooth all whole and quite sound mind what you are saying senor 
i say four if not five answered don quixote for never in my life have i had tooth or grinder 
drawn nor has any fallen out or been destroyed by any decay or rheum well then said sancho 
in this lower side your worship has no more than two grinders and a half and in the upper 
neither a half nor any at all for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand luckless that i 
am said don quixote hearing the sad news his squire gave him i had rather they despoiled 
me of an arm so it were not the swordarm for i tell thee sancho a mouth without teeth is like 
a mill without a millstone and a tooth is much more to be prized than a diamond but we who 
profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to all this mount friend and lead the 
way and i will follow thee at whatever pace thou wilt sancho did as he bade him and proceeded 
in the direction in which he thought he might find refuge without quitting the high road 
which was there very much frequented as they went along then at a slow pacefor the pain 
in don quixotes jaws kept him uneasy and illdisposed for speedsancho thought it well 
to amuse and divert him by talk of some kind and among the things he said to him in the joy 
of his heart and the praises he bestowed upon camilla all which lothario listened to without 
being able to show any pleasure for he could not forget how deceived his friend was and 
how dishonourably he had wronged him and though anselmo could see that lothario was not 
glad still he imagined it was only because he had left camilla wounded and had been himself 
the cause of it and so among other things he told him not to be distressed about camillas 
accident for as they had agreed to hide it from him the wound was evidently trifling and 
that being so he had no cause for fear but should henceforward be of good cheer and rejoice 
with him seeing that by his means and adroitness he found himself raised to the greatest 
height of happiness that he could have ventured to hope for and desired no better pastime 
than making verses in praise of camilla that would preserve her name for all time to come 
lothario commended his purpose and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument 
so glorious and so anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be 
in the world he himself persuaded he was conducting the instrument of his glory led home 
by the hand him who had been the utter destruction of his good name whom camilla received 
with averted countenance though with smiles in her heart the deception was carried on 
for some time until at the end of a few months fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which 
had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad and anselmo paid with 
his life the penalty of his illadvised curiosity chapter xxxv which treats of the heroic 
and prodigious battle don quixote had with certain skins of red wine and brings the novel 
of the illadvised curiosity in florence a rich and famous city of italy in the province 
called tuscany there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality anselmo and lothario 
such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them the 
two friends they were unmarried young of the same age and of the same tastes which was enough 
to account for the reciprocal friendship between them anselmo it is true was somewhat 
more inclined to seek pleasure in love than lothario for whom the pleasures of the chase 
had more attraction but on occasion anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those 
of lothario and lothario would surrender his to fall in with those of anselmo and in this 
way their inclinations kept pace one with the other with a concord so perfect that the 
best regulated clock could not surpass it anselmo was deep in love with a highborn and 
beautiful maiden of the same city the daughter of parents so estimable and so estimable 
herself that he resolved with the approval of his friend lothario without whom he did 
nothing to ask her of them in marriage and did so lothario being the bearer of the demand 
and conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short 
time he was in possession of the object of his love and poverty and want are the declared 
enemies of all these which he said to urge senor basilio to abandon the practice of those 
accomplishments he was skilled in for though they brought him fame they brought him no 
money and apply himself to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry which will 
never fail those who are prudent and persevering the poor man who is a man of honour if indeed 
a poor man can be a man of honour has a jewel when he has a fair wife and if she is taken from 
him his honour is taken from him and slain the fair woman who is a woman of honour and whose 
husband is poor deserves to be crowned with the laurels and crowns of victory and triumph 
beauty by itself attracts the desires of all who behold it and the royal eagles and birds 
of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure but if beauty be accompanied by want and 
penury then the ravens and the kites and other birds of prey assail it and she who stands 
firm against such attacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband remember 
o prudent basilio added don quixote it was the opinion of a certain sage i know not whom 
that there was not more than one good woman in the whole world and his advice was that each 
one should think and believe that this one good woman was his own wife and in this way he 
would live happy i myself am not married nor so far has it ever entered my thoughts to be 
so nevertheless i would venture to give advice to anyone who might ask it as to the mode 
in which he should seek a wife such as he would be content to marry the first thing i would 
recommend him would be to look to good name rather than to wealth for a good woman does not 
win a good name merely by being good but by letting it be seen that she is so and open looseness 
and freedom do much more damage to a womans honour than secret depravity if you take a good 
woman into your house it will be an easy matter to keep her good and even to make her still 
better but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mend her for it is no very easy 
matter to pass from one extreme to another i do not say it is impossible but i look upon it 
as difficult sancho listening to all this said to himself this master of mine when i say 
anything that has weight and substance says i might take a pulpit in hand and go about the 
world preaching fine sermons he preaches well who lives well said sancho and i know no 
more theology than that nor needst thou said don quixote but i cannot make out what thou 
art driving at what i am driving at said sancho is that your worship settle some fixed wages 
for me to be paid monthly while i am in your service and that the same he paid me out of your 
estate for i dont care to stand on rewards which either come late or ill or never at all god 
help me with my own in short i would like to know what i am to get be it much or little for the 
hen will lay on one egg and many littles make a much and so long as one gains something there 
is nothing lost to be sure if it should happen what i neither believe nor expect that your 
worship were to give me that island you have promised me i am not so ungrateful nor so grasping 
but that i would be willing to have the revenue of such island valued and stopped out of 
my wages in due promotion sancho my friend replied don quixote sometimes proportion 
may be as good as promotion i see said sancho ill bet i ought to have said proportion and 
not promotion but it is no matter as your worship has understood me and so well understood 
returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark 
thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs look here sancho i would 
readily fix thy wages if i had ever found any instance in the histories of the knightserrant 
to show or indicate by the slightest hint what their squires used to get monthly or yearly 
but i have read all or the best part of their histories and i cannot remember reading of 
any knighterrant having assigned fixed wages to his squire i only know that they all served 
on reward and that when they least expected it if good luck attended their masters they 
found themselves recompensed with an island or something equivalent to it or at the least 
they were left with a title and lordship if with these hopes and additional inducements 
you sancho please to return to my service well and good but to suppose that i am going to 
travel on foot and make long ones is to suppose nonsense thou sayest well sancho said don 
quixote but remember all times are not alike nor are people always in good humour im now 
ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coat torn and they come to ask me to whip myself 
of my own free will i fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness not considering 
the irresistible influence he brought to bear upon me let not that trouble you my lady 
said leonela for it does not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious 
to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized nay they are wont 
to say that he who gives quickly gives twice they say also said camilla that what costs 
little is valued less that saying does not hold good in your case replied leonela for love 
as i have heard say sometimes flies and sometimes walks with this one it runs with that 
it moves slowly some it cools others it burns some it wounds others it slays it begins the 
course of its desires and at the same moment completes and ends it in the morning it will 
lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it for there is no power that can resist 
it so what are you in dread of what do you fear when the same must have befallen lothario 
love having chosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you and it was 
absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved upon without affording 
the time to let anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be left unfinished 
for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs than opportunity and of opportunity 
he avails himself in all his feats especially at the outset all this i know well myself 
more by experience than by hearsay and some day senora i will enlighten you on the subject 
for i am of your flesh and blood too moreover lady camilla you did not surrender yourself 
or yield so quickly but that first you saw lotharios whole soul in his eyes in his sighs 
in his words his promises and his gifts and by it and his good qualities perceived how worthy 
he was of your love this then being the case let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas 
trouble your imagination but be assured that lothario prizes you as you do him and rest 
content and satisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth and merit 
that has taken you and one that has not only the four ss that they say true lovers ought to 
have but a complete alphabet only listen to me and you will see how i can repeat it by rote 
he is to my eyes and thinking amiable brave courteous distinguished elegant fond gay 
honourable illustrious loyal manly noble open polite quickwitted rich and the ss according 
to the saying and then tender veracious x does not suit him for it is a rough letter y has 
been given already and z zealous for your honour camilla laughed at her maids alphabet 
and perceived her to be more experienced in love affairs than she said which she admitted 
confessing to camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good birth of the same 
city camilla was uneasy at this dreading lest it might prove the means of endangering 
her honour and asked whether her intrigue had gone beyond words and she with little shame 
and much effrontery said it had for certain it is that ladies imprudences make servants 
shameless who when they see their mistresses make a false step think nothing of going 
astray themselves or of its being known all that camilla could do was to entreat leonela 
to say nothing about her doings to him whom she called her lover and to conduct her own affairs 
secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of anselmo or of lothario leonela said 
she would but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed camillas apprehension of losing 
her reputation through her means for this abandoned and bold leonela as soon as she perceived 
that there were people there she asked in a low voice if we were nizarani as much as to say 
or ask if we were christians i answered that we were and begged her to come down as soon as 
she recognised me she did not delay an instant but without answering a word came down immediately 
opened the door and presented herself before us all so beautiful and so richly attired 
that i cannot attempt to describe her the moment i saw her i took her hand and kissed it and 
the renegade and my two comrades did the same and the rest who knew nothing of the circumstances 
did as they saw us do for it only seemed as if we were returning thanks to her and recognising 
her as the giver of our liberty the renegade asked her in the morisco language if her father 
was in the house she replied that he was and that he was asleep then it will be necessary 
to waken him and take him with us said the renegade and everything of value in this fair 
mansion nay said she my father must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary 
he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible 
vanquish and destroy them even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish 
that they say are harder than diamonds and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of 
damascus steel or clubs studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more than once 
seen all this i say housekeeper that you may see the difference there is between the one 
sort of knight and the other and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a 
higher value on this second or more properly speaking first kind of knightserrant for 
as we read in their histories there have been some among them who have been the salvation 
not merely of one kingdom but of many ah senor here exclaimed the niece remember that all 
this you are saying about knightserrant is fable and fiction and their histories if indeed 
they were not burned would deserve each of them to have a sambenito put on it or some mark 
by which it might be known as infamous and a corrupter of good manners by the god that gives 
me life said don quixote if thou wert not my full niece being daughter of my own sister i 
would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the 
world should ring with what can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle 
a dozen lacebobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knightserrant 
what would senor amadis say if he heard of such a thing he however no doubt would forgive 
thee for he was the most humbleminded and courteous knight of his time and moreover a great 
protector of damsels but some there are that might have heard thee and it would not have 
been well for thee in that case for they are not all courteous or mannerly some are illconditioned 
scoundrels nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects 
some are gold others pinchbeck and all look like gentlemen but not all can stand the touchstone 
of truth there are men of low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen 
and high gentlemen who one would fancy were dying to pass for men of low rank the former 
raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues the latter debase themselves 
by their lack of spirit or by their vices and one has need of experience and discernment 
to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen so much alike in name and so different in conduct 
god bless me said the niece that you should know so much uncleenough if need be to get up 
into a pulpit and go preach in the streetsand yet that you should fall into a delusion so 
great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong 
when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age 
and above all a caballero when you are not one for though gentlefolk may be so poor men are 
nothing of the kind there is a great deal of truth in what you say niece returned don quixote 
and i could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish you but not to mix up things 
human and divine i refrain look you my dears all the lineages in the world attend to what 
i am saying can be reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings 
and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness 
those that had great beginnings and maintained them and still maintain and uphold the 
greatness of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended in a point 
like a pyramid upside down and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step 
by step until they come to be great lords so that the difference is that the one were what 
they no longer are and the others are what they formerly were not and i may be of such that 
after investigation my origin may prove great and famous with which the king my fatherinlaw 
that is to be ought to be satisfied and should he not be the princess will so love me that 
even though she well knew me to be the son of a watercarrier she will take me for her lord 
and husband in spite of her father if not then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off 
where i please for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents it comes to this 
too said sancho what some naughty people say never ask as a favour what thou canst take 
by force though it would fit better to say a clear escape is better than good mens prayers 
i say so because if my lord the king your worships fatherinlaw will not condescend to give 
you my lady the princess there is nothing for it but to commend ourselves to god and let 
fortune take what course it will god guide it according to my wishes and thy wants said 
don quixote and mean be he who thinks himself mean in gods name let him be so said sancho 
i am an old christian and to fit me for a count thats enough and more than enough for thee 
said don quixote and even wert thou not it would make no difference because i being the 
king can easily give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee for when 
i make thee a count then thou art at once a gentleman and they may say what they will but by 
my faith they will have to call thee your lordship whether they like it or not not a doubt 
of it and ill know how to support the tittle said sancho title thou shouldst say not tittle 
said his master so be it answered sancho i say i will know how to behave for once in my life 
i was beadle of a brotherhood and the beadles gown sat so well on me that all said i looked 
as if i was to be steward of the same brotherhood what will it be then when i put a dukes robe 
on my back or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count i believe theyll come a hundred 
leagues to see me thou wilt look well said don quixote but thou must have been suffering 
from cold in the head or must have smelt thyself for i know well what would be the scent of 
that rose among thorns that lily of the field that dissolved amber maybe so replied sancho 
there often comes from myself that same odour which then seemed to me to come from her grace 
the lady dulcinea but thats no wonder for one devil is like another well then continued 
don quixote now she has done sifting the corn and sent it to the mill what did she do when 
she read the letter as for the letter said sancho she did not read it for she said she could 
neither read nor write instead of that she tore it up into small pieces saying that she 
did not want to let anyone read it lest her secrets should become known in the village and 
that what i had told her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her and the extraordinary 
penance you were doing for her sake was enough and to make an end of it she told me to tell 
your worship that she kissed your hands and that she had a greater desire to see you than 
to write to you and that therefore she entreated and commanded you on sight of this present 
to come out of these thickets and to have done with carrying on absurdities and to set out 
at once for el toboso unless something else of greater importance should happen for she 
had a great desire to see your worship she laughed greatly when i told her how your worship 
was left doing penance in her service naked from the waist up in among these mountains 
like a savage sleeping on the ground not eating bread off a tablecloth nor combing your 
beard weeping and cursing your fortune in saying i cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong 
said don quixote for rather do i bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life not unless 
you go to sleep and havent the wit or skill to turn things to account and sell three six or 
ten thousand vassals while you would be talking about it by god i will stir them up big and 
little or as best i can and let them be ever so black ill turn them into white or yellow come 
come what a fool i am and so he jogged on so occupied with his thoughts and easy in his mind 
that he forgot all about the hardship of travelling on foot cardenio and the curate were 
watching all this from among some bushes not knowing how to join company with the others 
but the curate who was very fertile in devices soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose 
and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off cardenios beard and putting 
on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him a black cloak leaving himself in his breeches 
and doublet while cardenios appearance was so different from what it had been that he 
would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror having effected this although 
the others had gone on ahead while they were disguising themselves they easily came out 
on the high road before them for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did 
not allow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot they then posted themselves 
on the level ground at the outlet of the sierra and as soon as don quixote saw him he asked 
him can you tell me worthy friend and god speed you whereabouts here is the palace of the 
peerless princess dona dulcinea del toboso senor replied the lad i am a stranger and i 
have been only a few days in the town doing farm work for a rich farmer in that house opposite 
there live the curate of the village and the sacristan and both or either of them will be 
able to give your worship some account of this lady princess for they have a list of all 
the people of el toboso though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole 
of it many ladies there are of quality and in her own house each of them may be a princess 
well then she i am inquiring for will be one of these my friend said don quixote may be so 
replied sancho for i have heard say that the moors are mostly great lovers of berengenas 
thou must have mistaken the surname of this cidewhich means in arabic lordsancho observed 
don quixote very likely replied sancho but if your worship wishes me to fetch the bachelor 
i will go for him in a twinkling thou wilt do me a great pleasure my friend said don quixote 
for i will deliver thee out of the hands of the chaldeans much more out of those of the brotherhood 
but tell me as thou livest hast thou seen a more valiant knight than i in all the known world 
hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack more spirit in maintaining 
it more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing the truth is answered sancho that 
i have never read any history for i can neither read nor write though i can sign my name let 
us see it said the duchess for never fear but you display in it the quality and quantity 
of your wit sancho drew out an open letter from his bosom and the duchess taking it found 
it ran in this fashion sancho panzas letter to his wife teresa panza if i was well whipped 
i went mounted like a gentleman have done with these fooleries said don quixote let us 
push on straight and get to our own place where we will give free range to our fancies and 
settle our plans for our future pastoral life with this they descended the slope and directed 
their steps to their village chapter lxxiii of the omens don quixote had as he entered 
his own village and other incidents that embellish and give a colour to this great history 
chapter lxxiv of how don quixote fell sick and of the will he made and how he died as nothing 
that is mans can last for ever but all tends ever downwards from its beginning to its end 
and above all mans life and as don quixotes enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven 
to stay its course its end and close came when he least looked for it forwhether it was of 
the dejection the thought of his defeat produced or of heavens will that so ordered ita 
fever settled upon him and kept him in his bed for six days during which he was often visited 
by his friends the curate the bachelor and the barber while his good squire sancho panza 
never quitted his bedside they persuaded that it was grief at finding himself vanquished 
and the object of his heart the liberation and disenchantment of dulcinea unattained 
that kept him in this state strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up the bachelor 
bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life for which he himself he said 
had already composed an eclogue that would take the shine out of all sannazaro had ever 
written and had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard the flock one called 
barcino and the other butron which a herdsman of quintanar had sold him but for all this 
don quixote could not shake off his sadness his friends called in the doctor who felt his 
pulse and was not very well satisfied with it and said that in any case it would be well for 
him to attend to the health of his soul as that of his body was in a bad way don quixote heard 
this calmly but not so his housekeeper his niece and his squire who fell weeping bitterly 
as if they had him lying dead before them the doctors opinion was that melancholy and depression 
were bringing him to his end don quixote begged them to leave him to himself as he had a wish 
to sleep a little they obeyed and he slept at one stretch as the saying is more than six hours 
so that the housekeeper and niece thought he was going to sleep for ever but at the end of 
that time he woke up and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood by now noble company 
ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the world professing the 
of knighterrantry now i say ye shall see by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne 
captive there whether knightserrant deserve to be held in estimation and so saying he 
brought his legs to bear on rocinantefor he had no spursand at a full canter for in all this 
veracious history we never read of rocinante fairly galloping set off to encounter the 
penitents though the curate the canon and the barber who had already dismounted were 
waiting for them the carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about 
the pleasant green spot the freshness of which seemed to invite not enchanted people 
like don quixote but wideawake sensible folk like his squire who begged the curate to 
allow his master to leave the cage for a little for if they did not let him finish his battle 
he would kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him the lady in the coach 
amazed and terrified at what she saw ordered the coachman to draw aside a little and set 
herself to watch this severe struggle in the course of which the biscayan smote don quixote 
a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler which given to one without armour 
would have cleft him to the waist don quixote feeling the weight of this prodigious blow 
cried aloud saying o lady of my soul dulcinea flower of beauty come to the aid of this your 
knight who in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty finds himself in this extreme 
peril to say this to lift his sword to shelter himself well behind his buckler and to assail 
the biscayan was the work of an instant determined as he was to venture all upon a single 
blow the biscayan seeing him come on in this way was convinced of his courage by his spirited 
bearing and resolved to follow his example so he waited for him keeping well under cover 
of his cushion being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule which dead tired 
and never meant for this kind of game could not stir a step on then as aforesaid came don 
quixote against the wary biscayan with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting 
him in half while on his side the biscayan waited for him sword in hand and under the protection 
of his cushion and all present stood trembling waiting in suspense the result of blows 
such as threatened to fall and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making 
a thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of spain that god might deliver 
her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found themselves but it spoils 
all that at this point and crisis the author of the history leaves this battle impending 
giving as excuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements of 
don quixote than what has been already set forth it is true the second author of this work 
was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under 
the sentence of oblivion or that the wits of la mancha could have been so undiscerning 
as not to preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous 
knight and this being his persuasion he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this 
pleasant history which heaven favouring him he did find in a way that shall be related 
in the second part chapter ix in which is concluded and finished the terrific battle between 
the gallant biscayan and the valiant manchegan in the first part of this history will 
remember well enough the gines de pasamonte whom with other galley slaves don quixote 
set free in the sierra morena a kindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse 
payment from that evilminded illconditioned set this gines de pasamontedon ginesillo 
de parapilla don quixote called himit was that stole dapple from sancho panza which because 
by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when was stated in the first part has 
been a puzzle to a good many people who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was 
the error of the press in fact however gines stole him while sancho panza was asleep on 
his back adopting the plan and device that brunello had recourse to when he stole sacripantes 
horse from between his legs at the siege of albracca and as has been told sancho afterwards 
recovered him this gines then afraid of being caught by the officers of justice who were 
looking for him to punish him for his numberless rascalities and offences which were 
so many and so great that he himself wrote a big book giving an account of them resolved 
to shift his quarters into the kingdom of aragon and cover up his left eye and take up the 
trade of a puppetshowman for this as well as juggling he knew how to practise to perfection 
from some released christians returning from barbary it so happened he bought the ape 
which he taught to mount upon his shoulder on his making a certain sign and to whisper or 
seem to do so in his ear thus prepared before entering any village whither he was bound 
with his show and his ape he used to inform himself at the nearest village or from the most 
likely person he could find as to what particular things had happened there and to whom 
and bearing them well in mind the first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in which 
he lay and protrude his claws and stretch himself thoroughly he next opened his mouth 
and yawned very leisurely and with near two palms length of tongue that he had thrust forth 
he licked the dust out of his eyes and washed his face having done this he put his head out 
of the cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals a spectacle and demeanour 
to strike terror into temerity itself don quixote merely observed him steadily longing 
for him to leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him when he hoped to hew him 
in pieces so far did his unparalleled madness go but the noble lion more courteous than 
arrogant not troubling himself about silly bravado after having looked all round as 
has been said turned about and presented his hindquarters to don quixote and very coolly 
and tranquilly lay down again in the cage seeing this don quixote ordered the keeper to 
take a stick to him and provoke him to make him come out that i wont said the keeper for if 
i anger him the first hell tear in pieces will be myself be satisfied sir knight with what 
you have done which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of courage and do not seek 
to tempt fortune a second time the lion has the door open he is free to come out or not to come 
out but as he has not come out so far he will not come out today your worships great courage 
has been fully manifested already no brave champion so it strikes me is bound to do more 
than challenge his enemy and wait for him on the field if his adversary does not come on 
him lies the disgrace and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory that is true 
said don quixote and andres must have patience until my return as you say senora but i once 
more swear and promise not to stop until i have seen him avenged and paid i have no faith 
in those oaths said andres i would rather have now something to help me to get to seville 
than all the revenges in the world if you have here anything to eat that i can take with me 
give it me and god be with your worship and all knightserrant and may their errands turn 
out as well for themselves as they have for me sancho took out from his store a piece of bread 
and another of cheese and giving them to the lad he said here take this brother andres for 
we have all of us a share in your misfortune why what share have you got this share of bread 
and cheese i am giving you answered sancho and god knows whether i shall feel the want of 
it myself or not for i would have you know i am convinced as one who has gone through it that 
all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind take 
courage take courage for despondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on 
death to all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite that of the 
furious one was listening and raising himself up from an old mat on which he lay stark naked 
he asked in a loud voice who it was that was going away cured and in his senses the licentiate 
answered it is i brother who am going i have now no need to remain here any longer for which 
i return infinite thanks to heaven that has had so great mercy upon me mind what you are 
saying licentiate dont let the devil deceive you replied the madman keep quiet stay where 
you are and you will save yourself the trouble of coming back i know i am cured returned 
the licentiate and that i shall not have to go stations again you cured said the madman 
well we shall see god be with you but i swear to you by jupiter whose majesty i represent 
on earth that for this crime alone which seville is committing today in releasing you 
from this house and treating you as if you were in your senses i shall have to inflict such 
a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages and ages amen dost thou not know thou miserable 
little licentiate that i can do it being as i say jupiter the thunderer who hold in my hands 
the fiery bolts with which i am able and am wont to threaten and lay waste the world but in 
one way only will i punish this ignorant town and that is by not raining upon it nor on any 
part of its district or territory for three whole years to be reckoned from the day and 
moment when this threat is pronounced thou free thou cured thou in thy senses and i mad 
i disordered i bound i will as soon think of sending rain as of hanging myself those present 
stood listening to the words and exclamations of the madman but our licentiate turning 
to the chaplain and seizing him by the hands said to him be not uneasy senor attach no importance 
to what this madman has said for if he is jupiter and will not send rain i who am neptune the 
father and god of the waters will rain as often as it pleases me and may be needful the governor 
and the bystanders laughed and at their laughter the chaplain was half ashamed and he 
replied for all that senor neptune it will not do to vex senor jupiter remain where you 
are and some other day when there is a better opportunity and more time we will come back 
for you so they stripped the licentiate and he was left where he was and thats the end of 
the story so thats the story master barber said don quixote which came in so pat to the purpose 
that you could not help telling it master shaver master shaver how blind is he who cannot 
see through a sieve is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit 
valour with valour beauty with beauty birth with birth are always odious and unwelcome 
i master barber am not neptune the god of the waters nor do i try to make anyone take me for 
an astute man for i am not one my only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it 
makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of knighterrantry was in 
the field but our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed 
when knightserrant took upon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms the protection 
of damsels the succour of orphans and minors the chastisement of the proud and the recompense 
of the humble with the knights of these days for the most part it is the damask brocade and 
rich stuffs they wear that rustle as they go not the chain mail of their armour no knight 
nowadays sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven and in full panoply 
from head to foot no one now takes a nap as they call it without drawing his feet out of the 
stirrups and leaning upon his lance as the knightserrant used to do no one now issuing 
from the wood penetrates yonder mountains and then treads the barren lonely shore of 
the seamostly a tempestuous and stormy oneand finding on the beach a little bark without 
oars sail mast or tackling of any kind in the intrepidity of his heart flings himself into 
it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea that one moment lift him 
up to heaven and the next plunge him into the depths and opposing his breast to the irresistible 
gale finds himself when he least expects it three thousand leagues and more away from 
the place where he embarked and leaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures 
that deserve to be written not on parchment but on brass but now sloth triumphs over energy 
indolence over exertion vice over virtue arrogance over courage and theory over practice 
in arms which flourished and shone only in the golden ages and in knightserrant for tell 
me who was more virtuous and more valiant than the famous amadis of gaul who more discreet 
than palmerin of england who more gracious and easy than tirante el blanco who more courtly 
than lisuarte of greece who more slashed or slashing than don belianis who more intrepid 
than perion of gaul who more ready to face danger than felixmarte of hircania who more 
sincere than esplandian who more impetuous than don cirongilio of thrace who more bold 
than rodamonte who more prudent than king sobrino who more daring than reinaldos who 
more invincible than roland and who more gallant and courteous than ruggiero from whom 
the dukes of ferrara of the present day are descended according to turpin in his cosmography 
all these knights and many more that i could name senor curate were knightserrant the 
light and glory of chivalry these or such as these i would have to carry out my plan and in 
that case his majesty would find himself well served and would save great expense and 
the turk would be left tearing his beard and so i will stay where i am as the chaplain does 
not take me away and if jupiter as the barber has told us will not send rain here am i and i 
will rain when i please i say this that master basin may know that i understand him indeed 
senor don quixote said the duchess that in all you say you go most cautiously and lead in 
hand as the saying is henceforth i will believe myself and i will take care that my damsels 
wash you and even put you in the tub if necessary ill be content with the beard said sancho 
at any rate for the present and as for the future god has decreed what is to be attend to worthy 
sanchos request seneschal said the duchess and do exactly what he wishes the seneschal 
replied that senor sancho should be obeyed in everything and with that he went away to 
dinner and took sancho along with him while the duke and duchess and don quixote the music 
of the clarions ceased and then that of the lutes and harps on the car and the figure in the 
robe rose up and flinging it apart and removing the veil from its face disclosed to their 
eyes the shape of death itself fleshless and hideous at which sight don quixote felt uneasy 
sancho frightened and the duke and duchess displayed a certain trepidation having risen 
to its feet this living death in a sleepy voice and with a tongue hardly awake held forth 
as follows i am that merlin who the legends say the devil had for father and the lie hath 
gathered credence with the lapse of time of magic prince of zoroastric lore monarch and 
treasurer with jealous eye i view the efforts of the age to hide the gallant deeds of doughty 
errant knights who are and ever have been dear to me enchanters and magicians and their 
kind are mostly hard of heart not so am i for mine is tender soft compassionate and its delight 
is doing good to all in the dim caverns of the gloomy dis where tracing mystic lines and 
characters my soul abideth now there came to me the sorrowladen plaint of her the fair 
the peerless dulcinea del toboso i knew of her enchantment and her fate from highborn 
dame to peasant wench transformed and touched with pity first i turned the leaves of countless 
volumes of my devilish craft and then in this grim grisly skeleton myself encasing hither 
have i come to show where lies the fitting remedy to give relief in such a piteous case o 
thou the pride and pink of all that wear the adamantine steel o shining light o beacon polestar 
path and guide of all who scorning slumber and the lazy down adopt the toilsome life of 
bloodstained arms to thee great hero who all praise transcends la manchas lustre and 
iberias star don quixote wise as brave to thee i say for peerless dulcinea del toboso her 
pristine form and beauty to regain t is needful that thy esquire sancho shall on his own 
sturdy buttocks bared to heaven three thousand and three hundred lashes lay and that 
they smart and sting and hurt him well thus have the authors of her woe resolved and this 
is gentles wherefore i have come by all thats good exclaimed sancho at this ill just as 
soon give myself three stabs with a dagger as three not to say three thousand lashes the 
devil take such a way of disenchanting i dont see what my backside has got to do with enchantments 
by god if senor merlin has not found out some other way of disenchanting the lady dulcinea 
del toboso she may go to her grave enchanted but ill take you don clown stuffed with garlic 
said don quixote and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth and 
give you not to say three thousand three hundred but six thousand six hundred lashes and 
so well laid on that they wont be got rid of if you try three thousand three hundred times 
dont answer me a word or ill tear your soul out on hearing this merlin said that will not 
do for the lashes worthy sancho has to receive must be given of his own free will and not 
by force and at whatever time he pleases for there is no fixed limit assigned to him but 
it is permitted him if he likes to commute by half the pain of this whipping to let them be 
given by the hand of another though it may be somewhat weighty not a hand my own or anybody 
elses weighty or weighable shall touch me said sancho was it i that gave birth to the lady 
dulcinea del toboso stood waiting for them to give the necessary signal for the onset 
our lacquey however was thinking of something very different he only thought of what 
i am now going to mention it seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him 
as the most beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life and the little blind boy whom in 
our streets they commonly call love had no mind to let slip the chance of triumphing over 
a lacquey heart and adding it to the list of his trophies and so stealing gently upon him 
unseen he drove a dart two yards long into the poor lacqueys left side and pierced his heart 
through and through which he was able to do easily as camilla and leonela took care to give 
him the opportunity and so he placed himself in hiding in the state of agitation that it 
may be imagined he would feel who expected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare before 
his eyes and found himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he possessed 
in his beloved camilla having made sure of anselmos being in his hidingplace camilla 
and leonela entered the closet and the instant she set foot within it camilla said with 
a deep sigh ah dear leonela would it not be better before i do what i am unwilling you should 
know lest you should seek to prevent it that you should take anselmos dagger that i have 
asked of you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine but no there is no reason why i should 
suffer the punishment of anothers fault i will first know what it is that the bold licentious 
eyes of lothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a design 
so base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and of my honour go to the 
window leonela and call him for no doubt he is in the street waiting to carry out his vile 
project but mine cruel it may be but honourable shall be carried out first ah senora said 
the crafty leonela who knew her part what is it you want to do with this dagger can it be that 
you mean to take your own life or lotharios for whichever you mean to do it will lead to the 
loss of your reputation and good name it is better to dissemble your wrong and not give 
this wicked man the chance of entering the house now and finding us alone consider senora 
we are weak women and he is a man and determined and as he comes with such a base purpose blind 
and urged by passion perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may do what will 
be worse for you than taking your life ill betide my master anselmo for giving such authority 
in his house to this shameless fellow and supposing you kill him senora as i suspect you 
mean to do what shall we do with him when he is dead what my friend replied camilla we shall 
leave him for anselmo to bury him for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his 
own infamy under ground summon him make haste for all the time i delay in taking vengeance 
for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty i owe my husband anselmo was listening 
to all this and every word that camilla uttered made him change his mind but when he heard 
that it was resolved to kill lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself 
to avert such a disaster but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution so bold and virtuous 
he restrained himself intending to come forth in time to prevent the deed at this moment 
camilla throwing herself upon a bed that was close by swooned away and leonela began to 
weep bitterly exclaiming woe is me that i should be fated to have dying here in my arms the 
flower of virtue upon earth the crown of true wives the pattern of chastity with more to 
the same effect so that anyone who heard her would have taken her for the most tenderhearted 
and faithful handmaid in the world and her mistress for another persecuted penelope 
camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming to herself she said 
why do you not go leonela to call hither that friend the falsest to his friend the sun ever 
shone upon or night concealed away run haste speed lest the fire of my wrath burn itself 
out with delay and the righteous vengeance that i hope for melt away in menaces and maledictions 
i am just going to call him senora said leonela but you must first give me that dagger lest 
while i am gone you should by means of it give cause to all who love you to weep all their lives 
go in peace dear leonela i will not do so said camilla for rash and foolish as i may be to your 
mind in defending my honour i am not going to be so discourteous or so ungrateful as to have 
any quarrel be it ever so small with one i have eaten and drunk with besides who the devil 
could bring himself to fight in cold blood without anger or provocation i can remedy that 
entirely said he of the grove and rest assured that it is to woe itself and affliction itself 
you come don quixote finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous manner went 
over to him and so did sancho the doleful knight took don quixote by the arm saying sit down 
here sir knight for that you are one and of those that profess knighterrantry it is to me 
a sufficient proof to have found you in this place where solitude and night the natural 
couch and proper retreat of knightserrant keep you company to which don made answer a 
knight i am of the profession you mention and though sorrows misfortunes and calamities 
have made my heart their abode the compassion i feel for the misfortunes of others has 
not been thereby banished from it from what you have just now sung i gather that yours spring 
from love i mean from the love you bear that fair ingrate you named in your lament in the 
meantime they had seated themselves together on the hard ground peaceably and sociably 
just as if as soon as day broke they were not going to break one anothers heads are you sir 
knight in love perchance asked he of the grove of don quixote by mischance i am replied 
don quixote though the ills arising from wellbestowed affections should be esteemed 
favours rather than misfortunes that is true returned he of the grove if scorn did not 
unsettle our reason and understanding for if it be excessive it looks like revenge i was 
never scorned by my lady said don quixote certainly not said sancho who stood close by 
for my lady is as a lamb and softer than a roll of butter is this your squire asked he of the 
grove he is said don quixote i never yet saw a squire said he of the grove i have made up my 
mind and determined to have done with these drunken vagaries of these knights and go back 
to my village and bring up my children for i have three like three oriental pearls i have 
two said sancho that might be presented before the pope himself especially a girl whom 
i am breeding up for a countess please god though in spite of her mother and how old is this 
lady that is being bred up for a countess asked he of the grove fifteen a couple of years 
more or less answered sancho but she is as tall as a lance and as fresh as an april morning 
and as strong as a porter those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of 
the greenwood said he of the grove whoreson strumpet what pith the rogue must have to which 
sancho made answer somewhat sulkily shes no strumpet nor was her mother nor will either 
of them be please god while i live speak more civilly for one bred up among knightserrant 
who are courtesy itself your words dont seem to me to be very becoming o how little you know 
about compliments sir squire returned he of the grove what dont you know that when a horseman 
delivers a good lance thrust at the bull in the plaza or when anyone does anything very 
well the people are wont to say ha whoreson rip how well he has done it and that what seems 
to be abuse in the expression is high praise disown sons and daughters senor who dont do 
what deserves that compliments of this sort should be paid to their parents i do disown 
them replied sancho and in this way and by the same reasoning you might call me and my children 
and my wife all the strumpets in the world for all they do and say is of a kind that in the highest 
degree deserves the same praise and to see them again i pray god to deliver me from mortal 
sin or what comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them i quitted the island as 
i said without any escort except my ass i fell into a pit i pushed on through it until this 
morning by the light of the sun i saw an outlet but not so easy a one but that had not heaven 
sent me my master don quixote id have stayed there till the end of the world than another 
takes his place and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an enemy another 
and another will succeed him without a moments pause between their deaths courage and 
daring the greatest that all the chances of war can show happy the blest ages that knew 
not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery whose inventor i am persuaded 
is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention by which he made it easy for 
a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a gallant gentleman and that when he knows not 
how or whence in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts 
there should come some random bullet discharged perhaps by one who fled in terror at the 
flash when he fired off his accursed machine which in an instant puts an end to the projects 
and cuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come and thus when i reflect 
on this i am almost tempted to say that in my heart i repent of having adopted this profession 
of knighterrant in so detestable an age as we live in now for though no peril can make me 
fear still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity 
of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm 
i should have restored to liberty not only don gregorio but all the christian captives 
there are in barbary but what am i saying miserable being that i am am i not he that has been 
overthrown am i not he who must not take up arms for a year he saw the light of the glory of 
his achievements obscured the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smoke 
before the wind rocinante he feared was crippled for life and his masters bones out of 
joint for if he were only shaken out of his madness it would be no small luck in the end they 
carried him into the city in a handchair which the viceroy sent for and thither the viceroy 
himself returned cager to ascertain who this knight of the white moon was or was it some 
joke they were playing on don quixote don antonio replied that he neither knew who he was 
nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest this answer left the viceroy in a state 
of perplexity not knowing whether he ought to let the combat go on or not but unable to persuade 
himself that it was anything but a joke he fell back saying if there be no other way out of 
it gallant knights except to confess or die and don quixote is inflexible and your worship 
of the white moon still more so in gods hand be it and fall on he of the white moon thanked 
the viceroy in courteous and wellchosen words for the permission he gave them and so did 
don quixote who then commending himself with all his heart to his lady dulcinea imploring 
her to support him in such a peril with lance in rest and covered by his buckler he charged 
at rocinantes fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him but 
as he drove his lancepoint into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that 
it shivered the lance to pieces sweeping with it horse and rider who went rolling over 
on the plain in a sorry condition sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could 
go and when he came up found him unable to move with such a shock had rocinante fallen with 
him god bless me said sancho did i not tell your worship to mind what you were about for they 
were only windmills and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something 
of the same kind in his head hush friend sancho replied don quixote the fortunes of war 
more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations and moreover i think and it is 
the truth that that same sage friston who carried off my study and books has turned these 
giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them such is the enmity 
he bears me but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword god 
order it as he may said sancho panza and helping him to rise got him up again on rocinante 
whose shoulder was half out and then discussing the late adventure they followed the 
road to puerto lapice for there said don quixote they could not fail to find adventures 
in abundance and variety as it was a great thoroughfare for all that he was much grieved 
at the loss of his lance and saying so to his squire he added i remember having read how a 
spanish knight diego perez de vargas by name having broken his sword in battle tore from 
an oak a ponderous bough or branch and with it did such things that day and pounded so many 
moors that he got the surname of machuca and he and his descendants from that day forth 
were called vargas y machuca i mention this because from the first oak i see i mean to rend 
such another branch large and stout like that with which i am determined and resolved 
to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to 
come and see them and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed 
be that as god will said sancho i believe it all as your worship says it but straighten yourself 
a little for you seem all on one side may be from the shaking of the fall that is the truth 
said don quixote and if i make no complaint of the pain it is because knightserrant are 
not permitted to complain of any wound even though their bowels be coming out through 
it if so said sancho i have nothing to say but god knows i would rather your worship complained 
when anything ailed you for my part i confess i must complain however small the ache may 
be unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knightserrant also 
don quixote could not help laughing at his squires simplicity and he assured him he might 
complain whenever and however he chose just as he liked for so far he had never read of anything 
to the contrary in the order of knighthood sancho bade him remember it was dinnertime 
to which his master answered that he wanted nothing himself just then but that he might 
eat when he had a mind with this permission sancho settled himself as comfortably as he 
could on his beast and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed away in them he jogged 
along behind his master munching deliberately and from time to time taking a pull at the 
bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in malaga might have envied and while he 
went on in this way gulping down draught after draught he never gave a thought to any of 
the promises his master had made him nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation 
going in quest of adventures however dangerous they might be finally they passed the 
night among some trees from one of which don quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after 
a fashion as a lance and fixed on it the head he had removed from the broken one all that night 
don quixote lay awake thinking of his lady dulcinea in imitation of the lovers of marcela 
sancho panza settled himself between rocinante and his ass and slept not like a lover 
who had been discarded but like a man who had been soundly kicked chapter xiii in which 
is ended the story of the shepherdess marcela with other incidents bit hardly had day 
begun to show itself through the balconies of the east when five of the six goatherds came 
to rouse don quixote and tell him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial 
of chrysostom they would bear him company don quixote who desired nothing better rose 
and ordered sancho to saddle and pannel at once which he did with all despatch and with 
the same they all set out forthwith they had not gone a quarter of a league when the sound 
of a little bell fell on our ears a clear proof that there were flocks hard by and looking 
about carefully to see if any were within view we observed a young shepherd tranquilly 
and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his knife at the foot of a cork tree while don 
quixote dozed at that of a sturdy oak but a short time only had elapsed when a noise he heard 
behind him awoke him and rising up startled he listened and looked in the direction the 
noise came from and perceived two men on horseback one of whom letting himself drop from 
the saddle said to the other dismount my friend and take the bridles off the horses for 
so far as i can see this place will furnish grass for them and the solitude and silence my 
lovesick thoughts need of as he said this he stretched himself upon the ground and as he 
flung himself down the armour in which he was clad rattled whereby don quixote perceived 
that he must be a knighterrant and going over to sancho who was asleep he shook him by the 
arm and with no small difficulty brought him back to his senses and said in a low voice to 
him brother sancho we have got an adventure god send us a good one said sancho and where 
may her ladyship the adventure be where sancho replied don quixote turn thine eyes and 
look and thou wilt see stretched there a knighterrant who it strikes me is not over and 
above happy for i saw him fling himself off his horse and throw himself on the ground with 
a certain air of dejection and his armour rattled as he fell well said sancho how does your 
worship make out that to be an adventure i do not mean to say nor does it enter into my thoughts 
that the knighterrants calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell i would merely 
infer from what i endure myself that it is beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured 
one a hungrier and thirstier a wretcheder raggeder and lousier for there is no reason 
to doubt that the knightserrant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their lives 
and if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be emperors in faith it cost them 
dear in the matter of blood and sweat and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians 
and sages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and disappointed 
in their hopes that is my own opinion replied the traveller but one thing among many others 
seems to me very wrong in knightserrant and that is that when they find themselves about 
to engage in some mighty and perilous adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing 
their lives they never at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves 
to god as is the duty of every good christian in like peril instead of which they commend 
themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if these were their gods a thing which 
seems to me to savour somewhat of heathenism sir answered don quixote that cannot be on 
any account omitted and the knighterrant would be disgraced who acted otherwise for 
it is usual and customary in knighterrantry that the knighterrant who on engaging in 
any great feat of arms has his lady before him should turn his eyes towards her softly and 
lovingly as though with them entreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous 
venture he is about to undertake and even though no one hear him he is bound to say certain 
words between his teeth commending himself to her with all his heart and of this we have 
innumerable instances in the histories nor is it to be supposed from this that they are 
to omit commending themselves to god for there will be time and opportunity for doing 
so while they are engaged in their task for all that answered the traveller i feel some 
doubt still because often i have read how words will arise between two knightserrant 
and from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and they wheel their 
horses round and take a good stretch of field and then without any more ado at the top of 
their speed they come to the charge and in midcareer they are wont to commend themselves 
to their ladies and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches 
of his horse and with so heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead not stirring hand 
or foot the instant sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree and made all haste 
to where his master was who dismounting from rocinante went and stood over him of the mirrors 
and unlacing his helmet to see if he was dead and to give him air if he should happen to be 
alive he sawwho can say what he saw without filling all who hear it with astonishment wonder 
and awe he saw the history says the very countenance the very face the very look the very 
physiognomy the very effigy the very image of the bachelor samson carrasco as soon as 
he saw it flung himself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders and squeezed its 
throat with both hands with such force that the serpent finding he was throttling it had 
nothing for it but to stand upright or pull his hand off then it was he wished for the sword 
of amadis against which no enchantment whatever had any power then he cursed his ill fortune 
then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his absence while he remained there 
enchanted for that he believed he was beyond all doubt then he once more took to thinking 
of his beloved dulcinea del toboso then he called to his worthy squire sancho panza who 
buried in sleep and stretched upon the packsaddle of his ass was oblivious at that moment 
of the mother that bore him then he called upon the sages lirgandeo and alquife to come 
to his aid then he invoked his good friend urganda to succour him and then at last morning 
found him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull 
for he had no hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering which he believed would 
last for ever inasmuch as he was enchanted and of this he was convinced by seeing that rocinante 
never stirred much or little and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were to remain 
in this state without eating or drinking or sleeping until the malign influence of the 
stars which now prevails pass off the canon the curate and the barber told him he would 
act very wisely in doing as he said and so highly amused at sancho panzas simplicities 
they placed don quixote in the cart as before the procession once more formed itself in 
order and proceeded on its road the goatherd took his leave of the party the officers of 
the brotherhood declined to go any farther and the curate paid them what was due to them 
the canon begged the curate to let him know how don quixote did whether he was cured of his 
madness or still suffered from it and then begged leave to continue his journey in short 
they all separated and went their ways leaving to themselves the curate and the barber 
don quixote sancho panza and the bachelor samson carrasco don quixote remained very 
deep in thought waiting for the bachelor carrasco from whom he was to hear how he himself 
had been put into a book as sancho said and he could not persuade himself that any such history 
could be in existence for the blood of the enemies he had slain was not yet dry on the blade 
of his sword and now they wanted to make out that his mighty achievements were going about 
in print for all that he fancied some sage either a friend or an enemy might by the aid of 
magic have given them to the press if a friend in order to magnify and exalt them above the 
most famous ever achieved by any knighterrant if an enemy to bring them to naught and degrade 
them below the meanest ever recorded of any low squire though as he said to himself the 
achievements of squires never were recorded if however it were the fact that such a history 
were in existence it must necessarily being the story of a knighterrant be grandiloquent 
lofty imposing grand and true with this he comforted himself somewhat though it made 
him uncomfortable to think that the author was a moor judging by the title of cide and that 
no truth was to be looked for from moors as they are all impostors cheats and schemers he 
was afraid he might have dealt with his love affairs in some indecorous fashion that might 
tend to the discredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady dulcinea del toboso and to 
see that a letter of her name was placed at the beginning of each line so that at the end of 
the verses dulcinea del toboso might be read by putting together the first letters the 
bachelor replied that although he was not one of the famous poets of spain who were they 
said only three and a half he would not fail to compose the required verses though he saw 
a great difficulty in the task as the letters which made up the name were seventeen so if 
he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each there would be a letter over and if he made 
them of five what they called decimas or redondillas there were three letters short nevertheless 
he would try to drop a letter as well as he could so that the name dulcinea del toboso might 
be got into four ballad stanzas it must be by some means or other said don quixote for unless 
the name stands there plain and manifest no woman would believe the verses were made for 
her they agreed upon this and that the departure should take place in three days from that 
time don quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a secret especially from the curate and 
master nicholas and from his niece and the housekeeper lest they should prevent the execution 
of his praiseworthy and valiant purpose carrasco promised all and then took his leave 
charging don quixote to inform him of his good or evil fortunes whenever he had an opportunity 
and thus they bade each other farewell and sancho went away to make the necessary preparations 
for their expedition chapter v of the shrewd and droll conversation that passed between 
sancho panza and his wife teresa cascajo held the above irrelevant conversation don 
quixotes niece and housekeeper were not idle for by a thousand signs they began to perceive 
that their uncle and master meant to give them the slip the third time and once more betake 
himself to his for them illerrant chivalry they strove by all the means in their power 
to cheer him up the bachelor bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life 
for which he himself he said had already composed an eclogue that would take the shine 
out of all sannazaro had ever written and had bought with his own money two famous dogs 
to guard the flock one called barcino and the other butron which a herdsman of quintanar 
had sold him but for all this don quixote could not shake off his sadness his friends called 
in the doctor who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied with it and said that in 
any case it would be well for him to attend to the health of his soul as that of his body was 
in a bad way don quixote heard this calmly but not so his housekeeper his niece and his squire 
who fell weeping bitterly as if they had him lying dead before them the doctors opinion 
was that melancholy and depression were bringing him to his end don quixote begged them 
to leave him to himself as he had a wish to sleep a little they obeyed and he slept at one stretch 
as the saying is more than six hours so that the housekeeper and niece thought he was going 
to sleep for ever but at the end of that time he woke up and in a loud voice exclaimed blessed 
be almighty god who has shown me such goodness in truth his mercies are boundless and the 
sins of men can neither limit them nor keep them back the niece listened with attention 
to her uncles words and they struck her as more coherent than what usually fell from him 
at least during his illness so she asked what are you saying senor has anything strange 
occurred what mercies or what sins of men are you talking of the mercies niece said don 
quixote are those that god has this moment shown me and with him as i said my sins are no impediment 
to them my reason is now free and clear rid of the dark shadows of ignorance that my unhappy 
constant study of those detestable books of chivalry cast over it now i see through their 
absurdities and deceptions and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions 
has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading other books that 
might be a light to my soul niece i feel myself at the point of death and i would fain meet 
it in such a way as to show that my life has not been so ill that i should leave behind me the 
name of a madman for though i have been one i would not that the fact should be made plainer 
at my death call in to me my dear my good friends the curate the bachelor samson carrasco 
and master nicholas the barber wont have well seen it before theyll want to follow it and 
turn shepherds along with us and god grant it may not come into the curates head to join 
the sheepfold too hes so jovial and fond of enjoying himself thou art in the right of it 
sancho said don quixote and the greatest booby on earth not to be able to see that this courier 
is enchanted and this tosilos a sham one stop with him and take thy fill i will go on slowly 
and wait for thee to come up with me the lacquey laughed unsheathed his gourd unwalletted 
his scraps and taking out a small loaf of bread he and sancho seated themselves on the green 
grass and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents of the alforjas down 
to the bottom so resolutely that they licked the wrapper of the letters merely because 
it smelt of cheese said tosilos to sancho beyond a doubt sancho my friend this master of 
thine ought to be a madman ought said sancho he owes no man anything he pays for everything 
particularly when the coin is madness i see it plain enough and i tell him so plain enough 
but whats the use especially now that it is all over with him for here he is beaten by the 
knight of the white moon and a number of boys followed him too nay pursued him until they 
had him fairly housed in a hostel in the heart of the city don antonio eager to make his acquaintance 
entered also a squire came out to meet him and remove his armour and he shut himself into 
a lower room still attended by don antonio whose bread would not bake until he had found 
out who he was he of the white moon seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him said 
i know very well senor what you have come for it is to find out who i am and as there is no reason 
why i should suffer the punishment of anothers fault i will first know what it is that the 
bold licentious eyes of lothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal 
to me a design so base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and of my honour 
go to the window leonela and call him for no doubt he is in the street waiting to carry out 
his vile project but mine cruel it may be but honourable shall be carried out first ah senora 
said the crafty leonela who knew her part what is it you want to do with this dagger can it 
be that you mean to take your own life or lotharios for whichever you mean to do it will lead 
to the loss of your reputation and good name it is better to dissemble your wrong and not 
give this wicked man the chance of entering the house now and finding us alone consider 
senora we are weak women and he is a man and determined and as he comes with such a base purpose 
blind and urged by passion perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may do what 
will be worse for you than taking your life ill betide my master anselmo for giving such 
authority in his house to this shameless fellow and supposing you kill him senora as i 
suspect you mean to do what shall we do with him when he is dead what my friend replied camilla 
we shall leave him for anselmo to bury him for in reason it will be to him a light labour to 
hide his own infamy under ground summon him make haste for all the time i delay in taking 
vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty i owe my husband anselmo 
was listening to all this and every word that camilla uttered made him change his mind 
but when he heard that it was resolved to kill lothario his first impulse was to come out 
and show himself to avert such a disaster but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution 
so bold and virtuous he restrained himself intending to come forth in time to prevent 
the deed at this moment camilla throwing herself upon a bed that was close by swooned away 
and leonela began to weep bitterly exclaiming woe is me that i should be fated to have dying 
here in my arms the flower of virtue upon earth the crown of true wives the pattern of chastity 
with more to the same effect so that anyone who heard her would have taken her for the most 
tenderhearted and faithful handmaid in the world and her mistress for another persecuted 
penelope camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming to herself 
she said why do you not go leonela to call hither that friend the falsest to his friend the 
sun ever shone upon or night concealed away run haste speed lest the fire of my wrath burn 
itself out with delay and the righteous vengeance that i hope for melt away in menaces 
and maledictions i am just going to call him senora said leonela but you must first give 
me that dagger lest while i am gone you should by means of it give cause to all who love you 
to weep all their lives go in peace dear leonela i will not do so said camilla for rash and 
foolish as i may be to your mind in defending my honour i am not going to be so discourteous 
or so ungrateful as to have any quarrel be it ever so small with one i have eaten and drunk 
with besides who the devil could bring himself to fight in cold blood without anger or 
provocation i can remedy that entirely said he of the grove and rest assured that it is 
to woe itself and affliction itself you come don quixote finding himself answered in 
such a soft and courteous manner went over to him and so did sancho the doleful knight took 
don quixote by the arm saying sit down here sir knight for that you are one and of those that 
profess knighterrantry it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this place where 
solitude and night the natural couch and proper retreat of knightserrant keep you company 
to which don made answer a knight i am of the profession you mention and though sorrows 
misfortunes and calamities have made my heart their abode the compassion i feel for the 
misfortunes of others has not been thereby banished from it from what you have just now 
sung i gather that yours spring from love i mean from the love you bear that fair ingrate 
you named in your lament in the meantime they had seated themselves together on the hard 
ground peaceably and sociably just as if as soon as day broke they were not going to break 
one anothers heads are you sir knight in love perchance asked he of the grove of don quixote 
by mischance i am replied don quixote though the ills arising from wellbestowed affections 
should be esteemed favours rather than misfortunes that is true returned he of the grove 
if scorn did not unsettle our reason and understanding for if it be excessive it looks 
like revenge i was never scorned by my lady said don quixote certainly not said sancho 
who stood close by for my lady is as a lamb and softer than a roll of butter is this your squire 
asked he of the grove he is said don quixote i never yet saw a squire said he of the grove i 
have here two linen bags of the same size you shall take one and i the other and we will fight 
at bag blows with equal arms if thats the way so be it with all my heart said sancho but what 
has become of the lions are they dead or alive the keeper then in full detail and bit by bit 
described the end of the contest exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour 
of don quixote at the sight of whom the lion quailed and would not and dared not come out 
of the cage although he had held the door open ever so long and showing how in consequence 
of his having represented to the knight that it was tempting god to provoke the lion in 
order to force him out which he wished to have done he very reluctantly and altogether 
against his will had allowed the door to be closed what dost thou think of this sancho said 
don quixote are there any enchantments that can prevail against true valour the enchanters 
may be able to rob me of good fortune but of fortitude and courage they cannot sancho paid 
the crowns the carter put to the keeper kissed don quixotes hands for the bounty bestowed 
upon him and promised to give an account of the valiant exploit to the king himself as soon 
as he saw him his owner said i was wondering he did not answer for if he wasnt dead hed have 
brayed when he heard us or hed have been no ass but for the sake of having heard you bray to 
such perfection gossip i count the trouble i have taken to look for him well bestowed even 
though i have found him dead its in a good hand gossip said the other if the abbot sings well 
the acolyte is not much behind him so they returned disconsolate and hoarse to their village 
where they told their friends neighbours and acquaintances what had befallen them in 
their search for the ass each crying up the others perfection in braying the whole story 
came to be known and spread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood and the devil 
who never sleeps with his love for sowing dissensions and scattering discord everywhere 
blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of nothing contrived to make the people 
of the other towns fall to braying whenever they saw anyone from our village as if to throw 
the braying of our regidors in our teeth then the boys took to it which was the same thing 
for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of hell and braying spread 
from one town to another in such a way that the answers suited the questions and as no one 
crossquestioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape divined he made fools of them all 
and filled his pouch the instant he entered the inn he knew don quixote and sancho and with 
that knowledge it was easy for him to astonish them and all who were there but it would have 
cost him dear had don quixote brought down his hand a little lower when he cut off king marsilios 
head and destroyed all his horsemen as related in the preceeding chapter so much for master 
pedro and his ape and now to return to don quixote of la mancha after he had left the inn he 
determined to visit first of all the banks of the ebro and that neighbourhood before entering 
the city of saragossa for the ample time there was still to spare before the jousts left 
him enough for all with this object in view he followed the road and travelled along it 
for two days without meeting any adventure worth committing to writing until on the third 
day as he was ascending a hill he heard a great noise of drums trumpets and musketshots 
at first he imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way and to see them he spurred 
rocinante and mounted the hill on reaching the top he saw at the foot of it over two hundred 
men as it seemed to him armed with weapons of various sorts lances crossbows partisans 
halberds and pikes and a few muskets and a great many bucklers he descended the slope and 
approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags make out the colours and distinguish 
the devices they bore especially one on a standard or ensign of white satin on which there 
was painted in a very lifelike style an ass like a little sard with its head up its mouth 
open and its tongue out as if it were in the act and attitude of braying and round it were 
inscribed in large characters these two lines they did not bray in vain our alcaldes twain 
from this device don quixote concluded that these people must be from the braying town 
and he said so to sancho explaining to him what was written on the standard at the same time 
he observed that the man who had told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the 
two who brayed were regidors for according to the lines of the standard they were alcaldes 
to which sancho replied senor theres nothing to stick at in that for maybe the regidors 
who brayed then came to be alcaldes of their town afterwards and so they may go by both titles 
moreover it has nothing to do with the history of his worship senor don quixote i will bet 
the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets said sancho then i say said don quixote 
the author of our history will be some sage enchanter for to such nothing that they choose 
to write about is hidden what said sancho a sage and an enchanter why the bachelor samson 
carrasco that is the name of him i spoke of says the author of the history is called cide 
hamete berengena that is a moorish name said don quixote may be so replied the lad god be 
with you for here comes the daylight and without waiting for any more of his questions 
he whipped on his mules sancho seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied 
said to him senor daylight will be here before long and he is a very intelligent youth and 
deep in love and what is more he can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection the 
goatherd had hardly done speaking when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears and 
shortly after the player came up a very goodlooking young man of about twoandtwenty his 
comrades asked him if he had supped and on his replying that he had he who had already made 
the offer said to him in that case antonio thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing 
a little that the gentleman our guest may see that even in the mountains and woods there 
are musicians we have told him of thy accomplishments and we want thee to show them and 
prove that we say true so as thou livest pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love 
that thy uncle the prebendary made thee and that was so much liked in the town with all my 
heart said the gentleman that on the goletta runs thus chapter xl in which the story of 
the captive is continued sonnet blest souls that from this mortal husk set free in guerdon 
of brave deeds beatified above this lowly orb of ours abide made heirs of heaven and immortality 
with noble rage and ardour glowing ye your strength while strength was yours in battle 
plied and with your own blood and the foemans dyed the sandy soil and the encircling sea 
it was the ebbing lifeblood first that failed the weary arms the stout hearts never quailed 
though vanquished yet ye earned the victors crown though mourned yet still triumphant 
was your fall for there ye won between the sword and wall in heaven glory and on earth renown 
that is it exactly according to my recollection said the captive well then that on the 
fort said the gentleman if my memory serves me goes thus sonnet up from this wasted soil 
this shattered shell whose walls and towers here in ruin lie three thousand soldier souls 
took wing on high in the bright mansions of the blest to dwell the onslaught of the foeman 
to repel by might of arm all vainly did they try and when at length twas left them but to die 
wearied and few the last defenders fell and this same arid soil hath ever been a haunt of 
countless mournful memories as well in our day as in days of yore but never yet to heaven 
it sent i ween from its hard bosom purer souls than these or braver bodies on its surface 
bore the sonnets were not disliked and the captive was rejoiced at the tidings they gave 
him of his comrade and continuing his tale he went on to say the goletta and the fort being 
thus in their hands the turks gave orders to dismantle the golettafor the fort was reduced 
to such a state that there was nothing left to leveland to do the work more quickly and easily 
they mined it in three places but nowhere were they able to blow up the part which seemed 
to be the least strong that is to say the old walls while all that remained standing of the 
new fortifications that the fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease 
finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to constantinople and a few months 
later died my master el uchali otherwise uchali fartax which means in turkish the scabby 
renegade for that he was it is the practice with the turks to name people from some defect 
or virtue they may possess the reason being that there are among them only four surnames 
belonging to families tracing their descent from the ottoman house and the others as 
i have said take their names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral qualities 
this scabby one rowed at the oar as a slave of the grand signors for fourteen years and when 
over thirtyfour years of age in resentment at having been struck by a turk while at the 
oar turned renegade and renounced his faith in order to be able to cure him when he falls 
sick the chief thing i have to do is to attend at his dinners and suppers and allow him to 
eat what appears to me to be fit for him and keep from him what i think will do him harm and 
be injurious to his stomach and therefore i ordered that plate of fruit to be removed as 
being too hot and containing many spices that stimulate thirst for he who drinks much 
kills and consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists well then said sancho 
that dish of roast partridges there that seems so savoury will not do me any harm to this 
the physician replied of those my lord the governor shall not eat so long as i live why so 
said sancho because replied the doctor our master hippocrates the polestar and beacon 
of medicine says in one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala perdicis autem pessima 
which means all repletion is bad but that of partridge is the worst of all in that case said 
sancho let senor doctor see among the dishes that are on the table what will do me most good 
and least harm and let me eat it without tapping it with his stick for by the life of the governor 
and so may god suffer me to enjoy it but im dying of hunger and in spite of the doctor and all 
he may say to deny me food is the way to take my life instead of prolonging it your worship 
is right senor governor said the physician and therefore your worship i consider should 
not eat of those stewed rabbits there because it is a furry kind of food if that veal were 
not roasted and served with pickles you might try it but it is out of the question that big 
dish that is smoking farther off said sancho seems to me to be an olla podrida and out of 
the diversity of things in such ollas i cant fail to light upon something tasty and good 
for me absit said the doctor far from us be any such base thought there is nothing in the 
world less nourishing than an olla podrida to canons or rectors of colleges or peasants 
weddings with your ollas podridas but let us have none of them on the tables of governors 
where everything that is present should be delicate and refined and the reason is that 
always everywhere and by everybody simple medicines are more esteemed than compound 
ones for we cannot go wrong in those that are simple while in the compound we may by merely 
altering the quantity of the things composing them but what i am of opinion the governor 
should cat now in order to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes 
and a few thin slices of conserve of quinces which will settle his stomach and help his 
digestion sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the doctor 
steadily and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was and where he had studied he replied 
my name senor governor is doctor pedro recio de aguero i am a native of a place called tirteafuera 
which lies between caracuel and almodovar del campo on the righthand side and i have the 
degree of doctor from the university of osuna to which sancho glowing all over with rage 
returned then let doctor pedro recio de malaguero native of tirteafuera a place thats 
on the righthand side as we go from caracuel to almodovar del campo graduate of osuna get 
out of my presence at once or i swear by the sun ill take a cudgel and by dint of blows beginning 
with him ill not leave a doctor in the whole island at least of those i know to be ignorant 
for as to learned wise sensible physicians them i will reverence and honour as divine 
persons once more i say let pedro recio get out of this or ill take this chair i am sitting 
on and break it over his head and if they call me to account for it ill clear myself by saying 
i served god in killing a bad doctora general executioner and now give me something to 
eat or else take your government for a trade that does not feed its master is not worth two 
beans the doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion and he would have 
made a tirteafuera out of the room but that the same instant a posthorn sounded in the street 
and the carver putting his head out of the window turned round and said its a courier from 
my lord the duke no doubt with some despatch of importance the courier came in all sweating 
and flurried and taking a paper from his bosom placed it in the governors hands sancho 
handed it to the majordomo and bade him read the superscription which ran thus to don sancho 
panza governor of the island of barataria whom god prosper longer than me the duchesss 
bread would not bake as the saying is until she had read her letter and having looked over 
it herself and seen that it might be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear she read 
out as follows teresa panzas letter to her husband sancho panza i got thy letter sancho 
of my soul and i promise thee and swear as a catholic christian that i was within two fingers 
breadth of going mad i was so happy i can tell thee brother when i came to hear that thou wert 
a governor i thought i should have dropped dead with pure joy and thou knowest they say 
sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow and as for sanchica thy daughter she leaked from 
sheer happiness i had before me the suit thou didst send me and the coral beads my lady the 
duchess sent me round my neck and the letters in my hands and there was the bearer of them 
standing by and in spite of all this i verily believed and thought that what i saw and handled 
was all a dream for who could have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor of 
islands thou knowest my friend what my mother used to say that one must live long to see 
much i say it because i expect to see more if i live longer for i dont expect to stop until 
i see thee a farmer of taxes or a collector of revenue which are offices where though the 
devil carries off those who make a bad use of them still they make and handle money my lady 
the duchess will tell thee the desire i have to go to the court consider the matter and let 
me know thy pleasure i will try to do honour to thee by going in a coach neither the curate 
nor the barber nor the bachelor nor even the sacristan can believe that thou art a governor 
and they say the whole thing is a delusion or an enchantment affair like everything belonging 
to thy master don quixote and samson says he must go in search of thee and drive the government 
out of thy head and the madness out of don quixotes skull i only laugh and look at my string 
of beads and plan out the dress i am going to make for our daughter out of thy suit i sent some 
acorns to my lady the duchess i wish they had been gold send me some strings of pearls if 
they are in fashion in that island here is the news of the village la berrueca has married 
her daughter to a goodfornothing painter who came here to paint anything that might turn 
up the council gave him an order to paint his majestys arms over the door of the townhall 
he asked two ducats which they paid him in advance he worked for eight days and at the end 
of them had nothing painted and then said he had no turn for painting such trifling things 
he returned the money and for all that has married on the pretence of being a good workman 
to be sure he has now laid aside his paintbrush and taken a spade in hand and goes to the field 
like a gentleman pedro lobos son has received the first orders and tonsure with the intention 
of becoming a priest minguilla mingo silvatos granddaughter found it out and has gone 
to law with him on the score of having given her promise of marriage evil tongues say she 
is with child by him but he denies it stoutly there are no olives this year and there is not 
a drop of vinegar to be had in the whole village a company of soldiers passed through here 
when they left they took away with them three of the girls of the village i will not tell 
thee who they are perhaps they will come back and they will be sure to find those who will 
take them for wives with all their blemishes good or bad sanchica is making bonelace she 
earns eight maravedis a day clear which she puts into a moneybox as a help towards house 
furnishing but now that she is a governors daughter thou wilt give her a portion without 
her working for it the fountain in the plaza has run dry a flash of lightning struck the 
gibbet and i wish they all lit there i look for an answer to this and to know thy mind about 
my going to the court and so god keep thee longer than me or as long for i would not leave thee 
in this world without me thy wife teresa panza the letters were applauded laughed over 
relished and admired and then as if to put the seal to the business the courier arrived 
bringing the one sancho sent to don quixote and this too was read out and it raised some 
doubts as to the governors simplicity the duchess withdrew to hear from the page about 
his adventures in sanchos village which he narrated at full length without leaving a 
single circumstance unmentioned he gave her the acorns and also a cheese which teresa 
had given him as being particularly good and superior to those of tronchon the duchess 
received it with greatest delight in which we will leave her to describe the end of the 
government of the great sancho panza flower and mirror of all governors of islands chapter 
liii of the troublous end and termination sancho panzas government came to chapter liv 
which deals with matters relating to this history and no other the duke and duchess resolved 
that the challenge don quixote had for the reason already mentioned given their vassal 
should be proceeded with and as the young man was in flanders whither he had fled to escape 
having dona rodriguez for a motherinlaw they arranged to substitute for him a gascon 
lacquey named tosilos first of all carefully instructing him in all he had to do two days 
later the duke told don quixote that in four days from that time his opponent would present 
himself on the field of battle armed as a knight and would maintain that the damsel lied 
by half a beard nay a whole beard if she affirmed that he had given her a promise of marriage 
don quixote was greatly pleased at the news and promised himself to do wonders in the lists 
and reckoned it rare good fortune that an opportunity should have offered for letting 
his noble hosts see what the might of his strong arm was capable of and so in high spirits 
and satisfaction he awaited the expiration of the four days which measured by his impatience 
seemed spinning themselves out into four hundred ages let us leave them to pass as we do 
other things and go and bear sancho company as mounted on dapple half glad half sad he paced 
along on his road to join his master in whose society he was happier than in being governor 
of all the islands in the world well then it so happened that before he had gone a great way 
from the island of his government and whether it was island city town or village that he 
governed he never troubled himself to inquire he saw coming along the road he was travelling 
six pilgrims with staves foreigners of that sort that beg for alms singing who as they 
drew near arranged themselves in a line and lifting up their voices all together began 
to sing in their own language something that sancho could not with the exception of one 
word which sounded plainly alms from which he gathered that it was alms they asked for 
in their song and being as cide hamete says remarkably charitable he took out of his alforias 
the half loaf and half cheese he had been provided with and gave them to them explaining 
to them by signs that he had nothing else to give them they received them very gladly but 
exclaimed geld geld i dont understand what you want of me good people said sancho on this 
one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to sancho by which he comprehended 
they were asking for money and putting his thumb to his throat and spreading his hand upwards 
he gave them to understand that he had not the sign of a coin about him and urging dapple 
forward he broke through them but as he was passing one of them who had been examining him 
very closely rushed towards him and flinging his arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice 
and good spanish god bless me whats this i see is it possible that i hold in my arms my dear 
friend my good neighbour sancho panza but theres no doubt about it for im not asleep nor 
am i drunk just now sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find himself 
embraced by a foreign pilgrim and after regarding him steadily without speaking he was 
still unable to recognise him but the pilgrim perceiving his perplexity cried what and 
is it possible sancho panza that thou dost not know thy neighbour ricote the morisco shopkeeper 
of thy village sancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall his features 
and at last recognised him perfectly and without getting off the ass threw his arms round 
his neck saying who the devil could have known thee ricote in this mummers dress thou art 
in tell me who bas frenchified thee and how dost thou dare to return to spain where if they 
catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough with thee if thou dost not betray me 
sancho said the pilgrim i am safe for in this dress no one will recognise me but let us turn 
aside out of the road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat and rest and 
thou shalt eat with them there for they are very good fellows ill have time enough to tell 
thee then all that has happened me since i left her i have it here in my pocket and putting 
his hand into his right pocket he pulled out a masquerade nose of varnished pasteboard 
of the make already described and sancho examining him more and more closely exclaimed 
aloud in a voice of amazement holy mary be good to me isnt it tom cecial my neighbour and 
gossip why to be sure i am returned the now unnosed squire tom cecial i am gossip and friend 
sancho panza and ill tell you presently the means and tricks and falsehoods by which i 
have been brought here but in the meantime beg and entreat of your master not to touch maltreat 
wound or slay the knight of the mirrors whom he has at his feet because beyond all dispute 
it is the rash and illadvised bachelor samson carrasco our fellow townsman at this moment 
he of the mirrors came to himself and don quixote perceiving it held the naked point of 
his sword over his face and said to him you are a dead man knight unless you confess that 
the peerless dulcinea del toboso excels your casildea de vandalia in beauty and in addition 
to this you must promise if you should survive this encounter and fall to go to the city 
of el toboso and present yourself before her on my behalf that she deal with you according 
to her good pleasure and if she leaves you free to do yours you are in like manner to return 
and seek me out for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a guide to lead you to where 
i may be and tell me what may have passed between you and herconditions which in accordance 
with what we stipulated before our combat do not transgress the just limits of knighterrantry 
i confess said the fallen knight that the dirty tattered shoe of the lady dulcinea del 
toboso it was not bright enough to throw out beams at all it must have been that as her grace 
was sifting that wheat i told you of the thick dust she raised came before her face like 
a cloud and dimmed it what dost thou still persist sancho said don quixote in saying thinking 
believing and maintaining that my lady dulcinea was sifting wheat that being an occupation 
and task entirely at variance with what is and should be the employment of persons of distinction 
who are constituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show their rank 
a bowshot off thou hast forgotten o sancho those lines of our poet wherein he paints for 
us how in their crystal abodes those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their 
loved tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which 
the ingenious poet there describes to us how they were worked and woven with gold and silk 
and pearls and something of this sort must have been the employment of my lady when thou 
sawest her only that the spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything 
of mine changes all those things that give me pleasure and turns them into shapes unlike 
their own and so i fear that in that history of my achievements which they say is now in print 
if haply its author was some sage who is an enemy of mine he will have put one thing for another 
mingling a thousand lies with one truth and amusing himself by relating transactions 
which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history o envy root of all countless 
evils and cankerworm of the virtues all the vices sancho bring some kind of pleasure with 
them but envy brings nothing but irritation bitterness and rage so i say too replied sancho 
and i suspect in that legend or history of us that the bachelor samson carrasco told us 
he saw my honour goes dragged in the dirt knocked about up and down sweeping the streets 
as they say and yet on the faith of an honest man i never spoke ill of any enchanter and i am 
not so well off that i am to be envied to be sure i am rather sly and i have a certain spice of 
the rogue in me but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity always natural and 
never acted and if i had no other merit save that i believe as i always do firmly and truly 
in god and all the holy roman catholic church holds and believes and that i am a mortal enemy 
of the jews the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings 
but let them say what they like of me that sancho returned don quixote reminds me of what 
happened to a famous poet of our own day who having written a bitter satire against all 
the courtesan ladies did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable 
whether she was one or not she seeing she was not in the list of the poet asked him what he 
had seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others telling him he must 
add to his satire and put her in the new part or else look out for the consequences the poet 
did as she bade him and left her without a shred of reputation and she was satisfied by getting 
fame though it was infamy in keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who 
set fire to the famous temple of diana by repute one of the seven wonders of the world but 
none of these tombs or of the many others of the heathens were ornamented with windingsheets 
or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are 
saints thats the point im coming to said sancho and now tell me which is the greater work 
to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant the answer is easy replied don quixote it is 
a greater work to bring to life a dead man now i have got you said sancho in that case the fame 
of them who bring the dead to life who give sight to the blind cure cripples restore health 
to the sick and before whose tombs there are lamps burning and whose chapels are filled 
with devout folk on their knees adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in 
the other than that which all the heathen emperors and knightserrant that have ever been 
in the world have left or may leave behind them that i grant too said don quixote then this 
fame these favours these privileges or whatever you call it said sancho belong to the 
bodies and relics of the saints who with the approbation and permission of our holy mother 
church have lamps tapers windingsheets crutches pictures eyes and legs by means of which 
they increase devotion and add to their own christian reputation kings carry the bodies 
or relics of saints on their shoulders and kiss bits of their bones and enrich and adorn 
their oratories and favourite altars with them what wouldst thou have me infer from all 
thou hast said sancho asked don quixote my meaning is said sancho let us set about becoming 
saints and we shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after for you know 
senor
